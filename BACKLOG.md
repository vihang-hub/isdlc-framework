- [x] #250 Bug: FR-006 opt-in gap — isdlc-embedding generate and discover Step 7.9 ignore hasUserEmbeddingsConfig() [github: GH-250] -> [requirements](docs/requirements/BUG-GH-250-embeddings-opt-in-gap/) **Completed**
  - FR-006 opt-in guard (`hasUserEmbeddingsConfig`) now called at 4 entry points: `bin/isdlc-embedding.js` (runGenerate CLI — interactive readline prompt when TTY, silent skip when non-TTY), `bin/isdlc-embedding-server.js` (main() refuse-to-start with exit 1), `bin/isdlc-embedding-mcp.js` (module-level clean exit 0 before readline, MCP handshake fast-fail), `src/claude/agents/discover-orchestrator.md` (Step 7.9 single-line `node -e` pre-check + opt-out banner variant). 4 new test files covering 10 test gaps (TG1-TG10), all RED-first per ATDD, all GREEN after production lands. 5/5 AC coverage. Phase 16 68/68 in-scope tests green. Phase 08 QA approved (0 CRITICAL/MAJOR, 4 MINOR, 5 NIT — non-blocking). Out-of-scope: `lib/memory-embedder.js` session record embeddings (different data flow, follow-up).

- [ ] #240 Investigate: Jina v2 fp16 on CoreML routes to GPU instead of Apple Neural Engine [github: GH-240]
- [x] #239 Worker pool parallelism: engine's sequential batch loop defeats multi-worker speedup [github: GH-239] -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-GH-239-worker-pool-engine-parallelism/) **Completed**
  - Single-call engine dispatch (outer batch loop removed), unified `embed(texts, opts)` adapter interface, worker-pool concurrent progress callback (10-batch moving window + throughput + ETA + active_workers), memory calibrator (`lib/embedding/engine/memory-calibrator.js`), device-detector calibration integration, F0009 `refreshCodeEmbeddings` finalize handler (opt-in via `hasUserEmbeddingsConfig` raw-file check, bootstrap-safe skip, incremental spawn + /reload auto-start), install-time embeddings opt-in prompt (bash + node, exact-text validated), worker serial-queue drain (prevents concurrent-handler memory blowup on real inputs). 135 new unit tests green. Empirical validation on 24GB Mac: synthetic P4 = 60.5 c/s (4× scaling confirmed); real-chunk P4 = 0.73× P1 regression due to calibrator under-measurement (#248) and `graphOptimizationLevel: disabled` GH-238 workaround (#249). Architectural fix is correct; NFR-002 3× throughput target blocked on those two follow-ups. Config ships with `parallelism: 1` as the empirically-correct default for Jina v2 fp16 CoreML on 24 GB hardware.

### Parallel Workflows (Architecture)

- #30 [ ] Parallel workflow support — per-workflow state isolation enabling concurrent feature/fix sessions
  - **Problem**: `single_active_workflow_per_project` rule blocks parallel work. A developer can't work on one bug while another is in progress. The constraint exists because `state.json` has a single `active_workflow` field and all hooks assume one active context.
  - **Design**: Split state into per-workflow files with a shared index:
    ```
    .isdlc/
      workflows.index.json          ← lightweight: [{ id, type, branch, status, started }]
      workflows/
        BUG-0012/state.json         ← full workflow state (phases, current_phase, escalations, skill_usage_log)
        BUG-0013/state.json         ← full workflow state
      config/                       ← shared (unchanged)
      state.json                    ← project-level only (counters, project info, workflow_history, constitution)
    ```
  - **Hook resolution**: Dispatchers resolve `git branch → workflow ID → workflow state` once per invocation via `git branch --show-current` (~5ms), pass resolved state to all hooks. Branch name already maps 1:1 to workflow.
  - **Session binding**: At session start, `/isdlc` (no args) presents a picker if multiple workflows are active. Once selected, CLAUDE.md instruction scopes all operations to that workflow. After selection, hooks only read that workflow's state file.
  - **Git parallelism**: Requires `git worktree` for true parallel sessions (two checkouts in different directories) or separate clones. Without worktrees, workflows are still sequential but with better state isolation and no cancellation needed to switch.
  - **Migration scope**: ~20 files reference `readState()` — all dispatchers, standalone hooks, and common.cjs utilities need to resolve workflow-scoped state instead of global state.
  - **Performance impact**: +10-20ms per hook invocation (index read + branch resolution). Mitigated by caching within dispatcher runs.
  - **Complexity**: Medium-large (2-3 sessions through full iSDLC workflow)
  - **Prerequisite**: ~~BUG-0013 (phase-loop-controller same-phase bypass)~~ DONE

- #123 [ ] Event-sourced state model — replace CRUD state.json with append-only event log for team audit trails and concurrent workflow safety
  - **Problem**: `state.json` uses read-modify-write (CRUD) which breaks in team contexts: no audit trail (who approved which gate?), last-write-wins on concurrent access, no point-in-time state reconstruction, and mutable JSON provides no tamper evidence for Articles VI/IX accountability.
  - **Design**: Append-only event log replaces mutable JSON. Current state derived by replaying events. Events include actor attribution, timestamps, and phase context. `skill_usage_log` already follows this pattern — extend to all state.
  - **Relationship to #30**: Event sourcing eliminates the concurrent state isolation problem that #30 solves with per-workflow state files. Should be designed alongside #30 since both reshape state management.
  - **Migration scope**: ~20 files reference `readState()`/`writeState()`. `common.cjs` needs event-append + state-derivation functions. Compatibility layer needed during migration.
  - **Inspired by**: [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) Factor 12 (Stateless Reducer) — `(state, event) → new_state`
  - **Complexity**: Medium-large. Design alongside #30.

### Multi-Agent Teams (Architecture)

- #31 [~] Impact Analysis cross-validation — improve Phase 02 accuracy by enabling agents to cross-check findings (Approach A DONE — REQ-0015, Approach B still open)
  - **Problem**: M1 (Impact Analyzer), M2 (Entry Point Finder), and M3 (Risk Assessor) run in parallel but in **complete isolation** — no SendMessage, no cross-referencing, no awareness of each other's findings. The orchestrator consolidates after all complete, but nobody verifies consistency. M1 might say 7 files affected while M2 found entry points in 9 files, or M3's risk score might not account for coupling that M1 identified. Inconsistencies flow silently into sizing and downstream phases.
  - **Approach A — Post-hoc Verifier** [x] (DONE — REQ-0015: cross-validation-verifier.md agent, Step 3.5 in orchestrator, IA-401/IA-402 skills, 3-tier fail-open, 33 tests):
    - After M1/M2/M3 complete and before consolidation, spawn a Verifier agent that:
      1. Cross-references file lists (M1 affected files vs M2 entry point chains — files in one but not the other?)
      2. Validates risk scoring (does M3's risk level account for M1's coupling analysis and M2's chain depth?)
      3. Checks completeness (are all M2 entry points covered in M1's blast radius?)
      4. Flags inconsistencies for the orchestrator to resolve or surface to the user
    - **Cost**: +1 Task call after existing parallel phase
    - **Limitation**: Catches inconsistencies after the fact but can't improve what the agents found. If M1 missed a file, the Verifier can flag the gap but can't go analyse it.
  - **Approach B — Cross-pollination during execution** (richer, requires restructuring):
    - M1/M2/M3 still launch in parallel but share interim findings via SendMessage during execution:
      - M2 discovers a call chain through 3 modules → tells M1 to check those modules for coupling
      - M1 finds high coupling in a file → tells M3 to raise the risk score for that area
      - M3 identifies a test coverage gap → tells M2 to trace whether that gap is in a critical path
    - Pattern: **parallel with cross-pollination** — agents run simultaneously but broadcast interim discoveries. Lighter than full propose-critique-converge (no debate rounds, no convergence protocol), heavier than pure isolation.
    - Modeled on discover Phase 3's cross-review pattern (D8/D14/D15 review each other's outputs) but applied during execution, not after.
    - **Cost**: Same 3 Task calls but longer execution (agents wait for messages). Message budget: max 6 cross-messages total (2 per agent) to prevent runaway communication.
    - **Benefit**: Agents can act on each other's findings — M1 can re-analyse modules M2 flagged, M3 can adjust risk based on M1's coupling data. Better results, not just better validation.
  - **Recommendation**: Start with Approach A (low risk, immediate value), evolve to Approach B if inconsistency rate is high.
  - **Impact on sizing**: More accurate file counts and risk scores → more reliable sizing decisions (connects to #51)
  - **Complexity**: A = Low-medium (one new agent). B = Medium (SendMessage protocol, message budget, interim finding format)

### Developer Engagement Modes (Architecture)

- #32 [ ] Collaborative mode — developer as co-contributor alongside the AI, with parallel human tasks and artifact drop-in
  - **Problem**: In auto mode the developer sits idle for 15-60 minutes while the framework works. Supervised mode (REQ-0013) keeps them engaged as a reviewer, but the developer still isn't *producing* anything. Developers with domain expertise want to contribute — draft acceptance criteria, research competitors, sketch edge cases, write test scenarios — but there's no mechanism to feed that work back into the active workflow.
  - **Builds on**: Supervised mode (REQ-0013) — collaborative mode is supervised mode + contribution capabilities. REQ-0013 is a prerequisite.
  - **Design**:
    1. **Parallel task suggestions**: At phase boundaries (and during long phases), the framework suggests concrete tasks the developer can work on while the AI continues. Tasks have clear artifact formats and file paths:
       ```
       Phase 06 (Implementation) starting — estimated 20 min.

       While I work, you could prepare:
         → Edge cases for payment validation    → .isdlc/contributions/edge-cases.md
         → Domain notes on PCI-DSS compliance   → .isdlc/contributions/domain-research.md
         → Draft acceptance criteria for Phase 2 → .isdlc/contributions/acceptance-criteria.md

       Drop files in .isdlc/contributions/ — I'll pick them up at the next review gate.

       [Continue] → I'll work autonomously
       [Skip suggestions] → don't show these
       ```
    2. **Contribution drop-in**: `.isdlc/contributions/` directory watched at review gates. Any files placed there are read by the next phase agent as additional context. Contributions are tagged with the phase they were created during and the phase they're intended for.
    3. **Contribution integration**: At each review gate, the framework lists consumed contributions and shows how they influenced the output:
       ```
       Contributions consumed:
         ✓ edge-cases.md → 3 edge cases added to test-strategy.md
         ✓ domain-research.md → PCI-DSS constraints added to NFR matrix
         ○ acceptance-criteria.md → queued for next requirements phase
       ```
    4. **Task suggestion engine**: Per-phase lookup table of useful parallel human tasks, filtered by what's missing or weak in the current artifacts. Not a static list — contextual based on the feature being built.
    5. **Backlog refinement as a contribution type**: While the AI works on implementation, the developer can refine the project backlog — analysing UX issues from real usage, spotting inconsistencies, capturing developer feedback, refining existing items with fresh context. This is product ownership work that the AI can't do because it requires lived experience with the system. The framework suggests backlog-related tasks when relevant:
       ```
       While I work, you could also:
         → Review and refine upcoming backlog items    → BACKLOG.md
         → Capture UX issues from your recent usage    → .isdlc/contributions/ux-feedback.md
         → Note edge cases you've observed in production → .isdlc/contributions/observed-issues.md
       ```
       Backlog contributions are not consumed by the active workflow but are flagged at workflow completion for the developer to review and merge.
  - **Config**:
    ```json
    {
      "collaborative_mode": {
        "enabled": false,
        "suggest_tasks": true,
        "contributions_dir": ".isdlc/contributions",
        "auto_consume_at_gates": true
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Mode selection UX**: At workflow start, present mode choice (or read from config default):
    ```
    How would you like to work on this?
    [A] Auto — I'll handle it, minimal input needed
    [S] Supervised — pause for your review between phases
    [C] Collaborative — suggest tasks you can work on in parallel
    ```
  - **Key use cases**: developer has domain expertise the AI lacks, long-running workflows where idle time is wasted, team onboarding (developer learns by contributing alongside AI), complex features requiring human judgement on edge cases
  - **Scope**: Medium-large — contribution directory convention, task suggestion engine, gate integration, config. Depends on REQ-0013 (supervised mode) being complete first.
  - **Complexity**: Medium — builds on supervised mode infrastructure, main new work is task suggestion engine and contribution consumption logic

### Framework Features

- #35 [ ] Implementation learning capture: if bug fixes were identified during implementation or iteration loops > 1, create a learning for subsequent implementation
- #27 [ ] /isdlc validate command — on-demand artifact quality check (constitutional + completeness) without running a full workflow
- #28 [ ] Progressive disclosure / lite mode — expose only constitution → requirements → implement → quality loop for simple projects, full lifecycle opt-in
- #38 [ ] /isdlc refactor command and workflow — pre-requisite: 100% automated E2E testing
- #37 [ ] Separate commands to manage deployments and operations
- #40 [ ] Epic decomposition for large features (depends on adaptive workflow sizing / REQ-0011)
  - **Trigger**: Impact Analysis estimates `large` scope (20+ files) or `high` risk
  - **Process**: After sizing decision, Requirements Analyst re-enters to break the feature into sub-features with clear boundaries
  - **Execution model**: Each sub-feature gets an independent mini-cycle with its own gates:
    ```
    Sub-feature A → design → implement → test → gate
    Sub-feature B → design → implement → test → gate
    Sub-feature C → design → implement → test → gate
    Integration testing across A + B + C → final gate
    ```
  - **Benefits**: Catch problems early per sub-feature, reduce context window pressure, intermediate quality gates, partial progress is usable
  - **State tracking**: `state.json` tracks parent feature + sub-features with individual phase progress
- #41 [~] Ollama / local LLM support — enable and test the framework with Ollama-hosted open models (IN PROGRESS — core implementation merged REQ-0007, installer provider selection M2 done, remaining: end-to-end workflow test with local model)
  - Ollama v0.14+ natively implements the Anthropic Messages API, Claude Code supports it via 3 env vars (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
  - Quick start: `ollama launch claude` — or manual config with `claude --model <model>`
  - Recommended models: qwen3-coder, glm-4.7, gpt-oss:20b/120b (minimum 64k context window)
  - Re-enable the existing `/provider` skill (currently disabled) to manage Ollama configuration
  - **Test scope**: run a full iSDLC workflow (feature or fix) end-to-end with a local model — verify hooks, agents, state management, and gate validation all work correctly. Key risk: open models may struggle with iSDLC's complex multi-agent workflows (tool calling, large context, structured output).
  - **Known trade-offs**: quality near-parity with cloud Claude, but ~68x slower in benchmarks; best for privacy, zero-cost usage, demos, and learning
  - **Cloud variants**: Ollama `:cloud` models (e.g., `kimi-k2.5:cloud`) available for faster inference without API keys
  - **Not blocked by Anthropic**: In Jan 2026, Anthropic blocked third-party tools (OpenCode, xAI) from using Claude Pro/Max subscriptions to access proprietary Claude models (anti-arbitrage). Ollama + Claude Code is unaffected — it uses Anthropic's own CLI pointed at local open-source models, no Anthropic subscription or API key needed. Still working as of Feb 2026, though streaming and tool-calling edge cases are still being patched in Ollama.

### Code Quality Gaps

- #52 [x] Coverage threshold discrepancy — Constitution mandates 95% unit coverage but Phase 16 only enforces 80%
  - **Completed:** 2026-03-15

- #53 [ ] No automated complexity measurement — IC-04 relies on agent judgment, not tooling
  - **Problem**: The Implementation Reviewer's IC-04 check says "cyclomatic complexity >10 = BLOCKING" but this is pure agent judgment. No eslint-plugin-complexity, radon (Python), gocyclo (Go), or similar tool actually measures complexity. The agent estimates by reading the code — it can miss deeply nested logic or undercount decision points.
  - **Design**: Integrate automated complexity measurement into the quality pipeline:
    1. **Phase 16 Track B**: Add complexity analysis as a new check (QL-012). Detect available tool by project type:
       - JavaScript/TypeScript: `eslint-plugin-complexity` or `escomplex`
       - Python: `radon cc` or `flake8 --max-complexity`
       - Go: `gocyclo`
       - Java: PMD or Checkstyle complexity rules
    2. **Feed results into IC-04**: If automated metrics are available, the Implementation Reviewer uses them instead of estimating. If not available, falls back to agent judgment (current behavior).
    3. **Threshold**: Configurable per project in `state.json → project.quality_thresholds.max_cyclomatic_complexity` (default: 10)
  - **Same pattern as existing tool detection**: Phase 16 already detects eslint, tsc, jest, etc. This adds complexity tools to that detection.
  - **Complexity**: Low-medium — new QL skill, tool detection patterns, optional IC-04 data source

- #54 [ ] Agent-judgment quality checks lack automated backing — IC-01 through IC-07 have no tooling validation
  - **Problem**: All per-file checks in the Implementation Reviewer are agent judgment. The agent decides if there's a security issue (IC-03), a DRY violation (IC-04), or a missing error handler (IC-02). This is valuable but inconsistent — different agent runs may catch different issues. There's no automated baseline to validate against.
  - **Design**: Where automated tools exist, run them as a validation layer alongside agent judgment:
    | IC Check | Automated Tool Candidate |
    |----------|------------------------|
    | IC-01 (Logic) | No good automation — keep agent-only |
    | IC-02 (Error handling) | eslint no-empty-catch, no-unhandled-rejection rules |
    | IC-03 (Security) | semgrep, eslint-plugin-security, bandit (Python) |
    | IC-04 (Quality) | eslint-plugin-complexity, sonarqube (#42) |
    | IC-05 (Tests) | No good automation — keep agent-only |
    | IC-06 (Tech-stack) | Package.json/tsconfig validation — partially automatable |
    | IC-07 (Constitution) | No automation — constitutional compliance is semantic |
  - **Approach**: Don't replace agent judgment — augment it. If an automated tool finds an issue the agent missed, flag it. If the agent finds something the tool missed, that's the value of agent judgment. The combination catches more than either alone.
  - **Prerequisite**: #42 (SonarQube integration) would cover IC-02, IC-03, IC-04 in one tool. If SonarQube lands first, this item shrinks significantly.
  - **Complexity**: Medium — tool integration, result merging, fallback-to-agent-only when tools unavailable

### Developer Experience

- #56 [ ] Install script landing page and demo GIF — update the install script landing/README with a polished visual experience including an animated GIF demonstrating the framework in action (invisible framework flow, workflow progression, quality gates)

### Backlog Management UX

- #12 [ ] Auto-move completed BACKLOG.md headings when all items are done
  - **Problem**: When all items under a `###` heading are `[x]`, the entire heading block should move to `## Completed`. Currently not specified or implemented.
  - **Design**: After marking an item `[x]`, check if all siblings under same heading are also `[x]`. If yes, move entire heading block. Append `— COMPLETED {date}` suffix.
  - **Complexity**: Low-medium — extends the completion marking logic from #11

### Backlog & Analysis Redesign

> **Context**: Phase A/B separation is unintuitive. The user experience between managing backlog items, analyzing them, and building them doesn't flow naturally. This redesign unifies the pipeline around three natural verbs (add/analyze/build) with persona-driven interactive analysis and transparent quality enrichment. Inspired by BMAD party mode pattern.
> **Subsumes**: #50, #6, #8, #9, #10, #17

- #79 [ ] Introduce Critic/Refiner pass in analyze flow before confirmation summaries -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0036-introduce-critic-refiner-in-analyze-flow/)

### Harness Engineering Alignment

> Gaps identified by comparing iSDLC to [OpenAI's harness engineering methodology](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/). iSDLC already covers context engineering (CLAUDE.md, agents, constitution) and architectural constraints (hooks, gates, validation). These items address the missing pillars.

- #109 [ ] Entropy management agents (`/isdlc sweep`) — scheduled codebase health checks outside active workflows: doc-code consistency, constitution compliance, pattern drift, dependency health, dead code detection. Output: `docs/isdlc/sweep-report.md`. Config: `.isdlc/sweep.json`.
  - **Priority**: Should Have
  - **Complexity**: Medium-large
- #110 [ ] Observability-as-context for agents — feed runtime data (error logs, performance baselines, incidents) to Phase 02 tracing, impact analysis, and Phase 16 quality loop via `.isdlc/observability/` directory convention. Fail-open per Article X.
  - **Priority**: Could Have
  - **Complexity**: Medium
- #111 [x] Adaptive process complexity (rippable phases) — extend sizing/tier system with model confidence dimension. Phase-level skip conditions configurable in `.isdlc/process.json`. Audit trail for skipped/abbreviated phases. Override with `--strict`.
  - **Priority**: Should Have
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Builds on**: REQ-0011, #28, #97
- #112 [ ] Repository-first knowledge enforcement — detect undocumented ADRs, magic config values, and integration gaps. Knowledge gap detector in sweep, `[NEEDS DOCUMENTATION]` flags in Phase 01 roundtable, Article XV for constitution.
  - **Priority**: Should Have
  - **Complexity**: Low-medium
  - **Builds on**: #109 (entropy sweep)

### Process Enforcement

- [x] #118 Phase-work guard hook [github: GH-118] → `REQ-0141` -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0141-phase-work-guard-hook/) *(merged 1662ce2)*
  - **Completed:** 2026-03-26
- #120 [ ] Required skill execution enforcement — gate-blocker 6th check: before advancing, verify that required skills for the current phase were actually executed (present in `skill_usage_log`). Add `required_skills` array to each phase in `iteration-requirements.json` (subset of the agent's `owned_skills` — mandatory per invocation, not the full ownership list). Skill ownership remains shared (any agent can use any skill), but phase completion requires the listed skills to have been invoked. Config-driven: phases with no `required_skills` key skip this check.
  - **Priority**: Must Have
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Touches**: `gate-blocker.cjs` (or `gate-logic.cjs`), `iteration-requirements.json`, `skills-manifest.json` (reference), `validate-gate.cjs`

### Hackability & Extensibility

> Full design: [docs/isdlc/hackability-roadmap.md](docs/isdlc/hackability-roadmap.md)

**Tier 1 — Foundation**
- #97 [x] Gate profiles — configurable strictness levels (rapid/standard/strict)
- #98 [x] Workflow recovery — retry/redo current phase without restarting
- #99 [x] Workflow recovery — rollback to earlier phase

**Infrastructure**
- #115 [ ] Installer should inject monorepo protocol into user project CLAUDE.md — when `isMonorepo === true`, inject path routing table, project context delegation template, and workflow independence rules into generated CLAUDE.md
- #116 [x] Extract agent protocols from CLAUDE.md — move 8 shared protocols (Monorepo Mode, Constitutional Principles, Skill Observability, Suggested Prompts, Iteration Enforcement, Root Resolution, Git Commit Prohibition, Single-Line Bash) to `src/claude/protocols.md`. Update 31 agent files, 3 test files, CLAUDE.md.template. Wire into session cache.

**Tier 2 — Extension Points**
- #101 [x] User-space hooks — extensible pre/post phase hook points (.isdlc/hooks/)
- #102 [x] Custom workflow definitions — user-defined phase sequences (.isdlc/workflows/*.yaml)

**Tier 3 — Developer Productivity**
- #104 [x] Template system — closed as already-covered (discovery conventions, custom skills, semantic search)
- #106 [ ] Context carry-forward — reuse prior analysis across related workflows

**Tier 4 — Team & Organization Scale**
- #107 [ ] Constitution composition — base + project constitution merge for team sharing
- #108b [x] Full persona override — user controls analysis mode (personas/no-personas), verbosity, and roster; primaries demoted to recommended defaults; persona authoring docs -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0050-full-persona-override/) **Analyzed**
  - Depends on #108a (completed). 7 FRs, ~11 files, standard tier.

### 2026-02-23
- [x] REQ-0001 (#91): Implement SessionStart hook for skill cache injection — new `inject-session-cache.cjs` SessionStart hook reads pre-assembled `.isdlc/skill-cache.md` once at session start, outputs to stdout for LLM context injection. Eliminates ~200+ static file reads per workflow. New `bin/rebuild-cache.js` CLI, `rebuildSkillCache()`/`getProjectSkills()`/`buildCacheContent()` APIs in common.cjs, wired into discover and skill management commands.

- [x] BUG-0028 (#64): Agents ignore injected gate requirements — refactored `gate-requirements-injector.cjs` to emit structured CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS block with `buildCriticalConstraints()` and `buildConstraintReminder()` APIs. Updated 4 agents (software-developer, integration-tester, quality-loop-engineer, roundtable-analyst) to parse and obey injected constraints. Fixed 3 pre-existing branch-guard test failures. 108/108 tests, 18 files changed, 1110 insertions, 247 deletions *(merged d7b42b9)*.
- [x] REQ-0032 (#63): Concurrent phase execution in roundtable analyze flow — replaced monolithic `roundtable-analyst.md` with multi-agent architecture: `roundtable-analyst.md` (lead orchestrator) + 3 persona agents (`persona-business-analyst.md`, `persona-solutions-architect.md`, `persona-system-designer.md`) running Phase 02-04 concurrently. 6 topic files under `analysis-topics/` replace 24 step files.

Prunes stale/transient fields at workflow end, prevents unbounded state growth. 77 new tests, zero regressions. 2 files changed, 276 insertions *(merged f60f1cc)*.
- [x] #3: Framework file operations should not require user permission — added `Write(*/.isdlc/*)` and `Edit(*/.isdlc/*)` allow rules to `src/claude/settings.json`. Trivial tier, 1 tracked file changed *(commit 37a1501)*.
