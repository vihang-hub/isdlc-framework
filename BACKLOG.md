### Performance (remaining from 2026-02-13 investigation)

- 2.3 [x] T7: Agent prompt boilerplate extraction — ROOT RESOLUTION, MONOREPO, ITERATION protocols duplicated across 17 agents (~3,600 lines) -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0021-t7-agent-prompt-boilerplate-extraction/) **Completed: 2026-02-17**
- 2.4 [x] ~~Performance budget and guardrail system — enforce per-workflow timing limits and track regression as new features land~~ -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0022-performance-budget-guardrails/) **Completed: 2026-02-19**
  - **Problem**: The framework has been optimised from ~4x to ~1.2-1.5x overhead (T1-T3 done). But upcoming backlog items add significant agent calls — Creator/Critic/Refiner debates across 4 creative phases could add 12+ extra agent runs (~20-40 min worst case), Phase 06 Writer/Reviewer/Updater adds 2N calls for N files, and fan-out spawns multiple parallel agents. Without a performance budget, these features will erode the gains incrementally and nobody will notice until the framework feels slow again.
  - **Design**:
    1. **Per-workflow timing instrumentation**: Record wall-clock time per phase, per agent call, and per hook dispatcher invocation in `state.json` under `phases[phase].timing`. Already have `console.time()` in dispatchers — extend to full phase timing.
    2. **Performance budget per intensity**:
       | Intensity | Target Overhead | Max Agent Calls | Max Debate Rounds |
       |-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
       | Light | ≤1.2x native | No debates, no fan-out | 0 |
       | Standard | ≤2x native | Debates on creative phases, basic fan-out | 2 per phase |
       | Epic | ≤3x native | Full debates + fan-out + cross-validation | 3 per phase |
    3. **Budget enforcement**: At each phase boundary, the phase-loop-controller checks elapsed time against the budget. If over budget:
       - Log warning with breakdown (which phase/agent consumed the most time)
       - For debate phases: reduce remaining `max_rounds` to 1 (force convergence)
       - For fan-out: reduce parallelism (fewer chunks)
       - Never block — degrade gracefully, don't halt the workflow
    4. **Regression tracking**: At workflow completion, append timing summary to `workflow_history`. Compare against rolling average of last 5 workflows of same intensity. Flag if >20% slower with breakdown of where time went.
    5. **Dashboard at completion**: Show timing summary when workflow finishes:
       ```
       Workflow completed in 47m 12s (standard budget: 60m)
         Phase 01 (Requirements):  8m 32s  [2 debate rounds]
         Phase 02 (Impact):        1m 04s
         Phase 03 (Architecture):  9m 18s  [2 debate rounds]
         Phase 04 (Design):        7m 45s  [1 debate round]
         Phase 05 (Test Strategy): 3m 12s
         Phase 06 (Implementation): 12m 41s [8 files, 3 review cycles]
         Phase 16 (Quality Loop):  2m 48s  [4-way fan-out]
         Phase 08 (Code Review):   1m 52s
       ```
  - **What it protects**: Every new backlog item (~~4.1 debates~~ DONE, #31 cross-pollination, ~~4.3 fan-out~~ DONE, #32 collaborative mode) must stay within the intensity budget. If a feature consistently blows the budget, it gets flagged for optimisation before the next release.
  - **Builds on**: T1-T3 dispatcher timing, state.json workflow_history (REQ-0005), sizing intensity system (REQ-0011)
  - **Complexity**: Medium — instrumentation is straightforward, budget enforcement needs careful degradation logic

### Parallel Workflows (Architecture)

- #30 [ ] Parallel workflow support — per-workflow state isolation enabling concurrent feature/fix sessions
  - **Problem**: `single_active_workflow_per_project` rule blocks parallel work. A developer can't work on one bug while another is in progress. The constraint exists because `state.json` has a single `active_workflow` field and all hooks assume one active context.
  - **Design**: Split state into per-workflow files with a shared index:
    ```
    .isdlc/
      workflows.index.json          ← lightweight: [{ id, type, branch, status, started }]
      workflows/
        BUG-0012/state.json         ← full workflow state (phases, current_phase, escalations, skill_usage_log)
        BUG-0013/state.json         ← full workflow state
      config/                       ← shared (unchanged)
      state.json                    ← project-level only (counters, project info, workflow_history, constitution)
    ```
  - **Hook resolution**: Dispatchers resolve `git branch → workflow ID → workflow state` once per invocation via `git branch --show-current` (~5ms), pass resolved state to all hooks. Branch name already maps 1:1 to workflow.
  - **Session binding**: At session start, `/isdlc` (no args) presents a picker if multiple workflows are active. Once selected, CLAUDE.md instruction scopes all operations to that workflow. After selection, hooks only read that workflow's state file.
  - **Git parallelism**: Requires `git worktree` for true parallel sessions (two checkouts in different directories) or separate clones. Without worktrees, workflows are still sequential but with better state isolation and no cancellation needed to switch.
  - **Migration scope**: ~20 files reference `readState()` — all dispatchers, standalone hooks, and common.cjs utilities need to resolve workflow-scoped state instead of global state.
  - **Performance impact**: +10-20ms per hook invocation (index read + branch resolution). Mitigated by caching within dispatcher runs.
  - **Complexity**: Medium-large (2-3 sessions through full iSDLC workflow)
  - **Prerequisite**: ~~BUG-0013 (phase-loop-controller same-phase bypass)~~ DONE

### Multi-Agent Teams (Architecture)

- #31 [~] Impact Analysis cross-validation — improve Phase 02 accuracy by enabling agents to cross-check findings (Approach A DONE — REQ-0015, Approach B still open)
  - **Problem**: M1 (Impact Analyzer), M2 (Entry Point Finder), and M3 (Risk Assessor) run in parallel but in **complete isolation** — no SendMessage, no cross-referencing, no awareness of each other's findings. The orchestrator consolidates after all complete, but nobody verifies consistency. M1 might say 7 files affected while M2 found entry points in 9 files, or M3's risk score might not account for coupling that M1 identified. Inconsistencies flow silently into sizing and downstream phases.
  - **Approach A — Post-hoc Verifier** [x] (DONE — REQ-0015: cross-validation-verifier.md agent, Step 3.5 in orchestrator, IA-401/IA-402 skills, 3-tier fail-open, 33 tests):
    - After M1/M2/M3 complete and before consolidation, spawn a Verifier agent that:
      1. Cross-references file lists (M1 affected files vs M2 entry point chains — files in one but not the other?)
      2. Validates risk scoring (does M3's risk level account for M1's coupling analysis and M2's chain depth?)
      3. Checks completeness (are all M2 entry points covered in M1's blast radius?)
      4. Flags inconsistencies for the orchestrator to resolve or surface to the user
    - **Cost**: +1 Task call after existing parallel phase
    - **Limitation**: Catches inconsistencies after the fact but can't improve what the agents found. If M1 missed a file, the Verifier can flag the gap but can't go analyse it.
  - **Approach B — Cross-pollination during execution** (richer, requires restructuring):
    - M1/M2/M3 still launch in parallel but share interim findings via SendMessage during execution:
      - M2 discovers a call chain through 3 modules → tells M1 to check those modules for coupling
      - M1 finds high coupling in a file → tells M3 to raise the risk score for that area
      - M3 identifies a test coverage gap → tells M2 to trace whether that gap is in a critical path
    - Pattern: **parallel with cross-pollination** — agents run simultaneously but broadcast interim discoveries. Lighter than full propose-critique-converge (no debate rounds, no convergence protocol), heavier than pure isolation.
    - Modeled on discover Phase 3's cross-review pattern (D8/D14/D15 review each other's outputs) but applied during execution, not after.
    - **Cost**: Same 3 Task calls but longer execution (agents wait for messages). Message budget: max 6 cross-messages total (2 per agent) to prevent runaway communication.
    - **Benefit**: Agents can act on each other's findings — M1 can re-analyse modules M2 flagged, M3 can adjust risk based on M1's coupling data. Better results, not just better validation.
  - **Recommendation**: Start with Approach A (low risk, immediate value), evolve to Approach B if inconsistency rate is high.
  - **Impact on sizing**: More accurate file counts and risk scores → more reliable sizing decisions (connects to #51)
  - **Complexity**: A = Low-medium (one new agent). B = Medium (SendMessage protocol, message budget, interim finding format)

### Developer Engagement Modes (Architecture)

- #32 [ ] Collaborative mode — developer as co-contributor alongside the AI, with parallel human tasks and artifact drop-in
  - **Problem**: In auto mode the developer sits idle for 15-60 minutes while the framework works. Supervised mode (REQ-0013) keeps them engaged as a reviewer, but the developer still isn't *producing* anything. Developers with domain expertise want to contribute — draft acceptance criteria, research competitors, sketch edge cases, write test scenarios — but there's no mechanism to feed that work back into the active workflow.
  - **Builds on**: Supervised mode (REQ-0013) — collaborative mode is supervised mode + contribution capabilities. REQ-0013 is a prerequisite.
  - **Design**:
    1. **Parallel task suggestions**: At phase boundaries (and during long phases), the framework suggests concrete tasks the developer can work on while the AI continues. Tasks have clear artifact formats and file paths:
       ```
       Phase 06 (Implementation) starting — estimated 20 min.

       While I work, you could prepare:
         → Edge cases for payment validation    → .isdlc/contributions/edge-cases.md
         → Domain notes on PCI-DSS compliance   → .isdlc/contributions/domain-research.md
         → Draft acceptance criteria for Phase 2 → .isdlc/contributions/acceptance-criteria.md

       Drop files in .isdlc/contributions/ — I'll pick them up at the next review gate.

       [Continue] → I'll work autonomously
       [Skip suggestions] → don't show these
       ```
    2. **Contribution drop-in**: `.isdlc/contributions/` directory watched at review gates. Any files placed there are read by the next phase agent as additional context. Contributions are tagged with the phase they were created during and the phase they're intended for.
    3. **Contribution integration**: At each review gate, the framework lists consumed contributions and shows how they influenced the output:
       ```
       Contributions consumed:
         ✓ edge-cases.md → 3 edge cases added to test-strategy.md
         ✓ domain-research.md → PCI-DSS constraints added to NFR matrix
         ○ acceptance-criteria.md → queued for next requirements phase
       ```
    4. **Task suggestion engine**: Per-phase lookup table of useful parallel human tasks, filtered by what's missing or weak in the current artifacts. Not a static list — contextual based on the feature being built.
    5. **Backlog refinement as a contribution type**: While the AI works on implementation, the developer can refine the project backlog — analysing UX issues from real usage, spotting inconsistencies, capturing developer feedback, refining existing items with fresh context. This is product ownership work that the AI can't do because it requires lived experience with the system. The framework suggests backlog-related tasks when relevant:
       ```
       While I work, you could also:
         → Review and refine upcoming backlog items    → BACKLOG.md
         → Capture UX issues from your recent usage    → .isdlc/contributions/ux-feedback.md
         → Note edge cases you've observed in production → .isdlc/contributions/observed-issues.md
       ```
       Backlog contributions are not consumed by the active workflow but are flagged at workflow completion for the developer to review and merge.
  - **Config**:
    ```json
    {
      "collaborative_mode": {
        "enabled": false,
        "suggest_tasks": true,
        "contributions_dir": ".isdlc/contributions",
        "auto_consume_at_gates": true
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Mode selection UX**: At workflow start, present mode choice (or read from config default):
    ```
    How would you like to work on this?
    [A] Auto — I'll handle it, minimal input needed
    [S] Supervised — pause for your review between phases
    [C] Collaborative — suggest tasks you can work on in parallel
    ```
  - **Key use cases**: developer has domain expertise the AI lacks, long-running workflows where idle time is wasted, team onboarding (developer learns by contributing alongside AI), complex features requiring human judgement on edge cases
  - **Scope**: Medium-large — contribution directory convention, task suggestion engine, gate integration, config. Depends on REQ-0013 (supervised mode) being complete first.
  - **Complexity**: Medium — builds on supervised mode infrastructure, main new work is task suggestion engine and contribution consumption logic

### Skills Management

*All items #81-#91 completed — see Completed section below.*

### Framework Features

- #33 [ ] TOON format integration — adopt Token-Oriented Object Notation for agent prompts and state data to reduce token usage
  - TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) reduces token consumption by 30-60% vs JSON while maintaining or improving LLM accuracy
  - Sweet spot: uniform arrays (tabular data like skill manifests, phase tables, workflow history) — field names declared once as header, rows follow
  - Less effective for deeply nested/non-uniform structures (keep JSON for those)
  - SDKs available: TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, .NET ([github.com/toon-format/toon](https://github.com/toon-format/toon))
  - **Candidate areas**: skills-manifest.json, state.json arrays, agent prompt data injection, hook config loading
  - **Not a full JSON replacement** — complement for token-heavy tabular data only
- #34 [ ] Improve search capabilities to help Claude be more effective
- #35 [ ] Implementation learning capture: if bug fixes were identified during implementation or iteration loops > 1, create a learning for subsequent implementation
- #27 [ ] /isdlc validate command — on-demand artifact quality check (constitutional + completeness) without running a full workflow
- #28 [ ] Progressive disclosure / lite mode — expose only constitution → requirements → implement → quality loop for simple projects, full lifecycle opt-in
- #38 [ ] /isdlc refactor command and workflow — pre-requisite: 100% automated E2E testing
- #37 [ ] Separate commands to manage deployments and operations
- #39 [x] ~~State.json pruning at workflow completion~~ -> [requirements](docs/requirements/state-json-pruning-GH-39/) **Completed: 2026-02-21** *(merged f60f1cc)*
- #40 [ ] Epic decomposition for large features (depends on adaptive workflow sizing / REQ-0011)
  - **Trigger**: Impact Analysis estimates `large` scope (20+ files) or `high` risk
  - **Process**: After sizing decision, Requirements Analyst re-enters to break the feature into sub-features with clear boundaries
  - **Execution model**: Each sub-feature gets an independent mini-cycle with its own gates:
    ```
    Sub-feature A → design → implement → test → gate
    Sub-feature B → design → implement → test → gate
    Sub-feature C → design → implement → test → gate
    Integration testing across A + B + C → final gate
    ```
  - **Benefits**: Catch problems early per sub-feature, reduce context window pressure, intermediate quality gates, partial progress is usable
  - **State tracking**: `state.json` tracks parent feature + sub-features with individual phase progress
- #41 [~] Ollama / local LLM support — enable and test the framework with Ollama-hosted open models (IN PROGRESS — core implementation merged REQ-0007, installer provider selection M2 done, remaining: end-to-end workflow test with local model)
  - Ollama v0.14+ natively implements the Anthropic Messages API, Claude Code supports it via 3 env vars (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
  - Quick start: `ollama launch claude` — or manual config with `claude --model <model>`
  - Recommended models: qwen3-coder, glm-4.7, gpt-oss:20b/120b (minimum 64k context window)
  - Re-enable the existing `/provider` skill (currently disabled) to manage Ollama configuration
  - **Test scope**: run a full iSDLC workflow (feature or fix) end-to-end with a local model — verify hooks, agents, state management, and gate validation all work correctly. Key risk: open models may struggle with iSDLC's complex multi-agent workflows (tool calling, large context, structured output).
  - **Known trade-offs**: quality near-parity with cloud Claude, but ~68x slower in benchmarks; best for privacy, zero-cost usage, demos, and learning
  - **Cloud variants**: Ollama `:cloud` models (e.g., `kimi-k2.5:cloud`) available for faster inference without API keys
  - **Not blocked by Anthropic**: In Jan 2026, Anthropic blocked third-party tools (OpenCode, xAI) from using Claude Pro/Max subscriptions to access proprietary Claude models (anti-arbitrage). Ollama + Claude Code is unaffected — it uses Anthropic's own CLI pointed at local open-source models, no Anthropic subscription or API key needed. Still working as of Feb 2026, though streaming and tool-calling edge cases are still being patched in Ollama.

  - **Completed:** 2026-02-24

### Workflow Quality

- #51 [x] ~~Sizing decision must always prompt the user — silent fallback paths bypass user consent~~ *(completed, merged 3de5162)*

- **Feature A: Analyze Decisions** (#57 + #59) [x] ~~Post-Phase-02 tier + sizing in analyze verb~~ **Completed: 2026-02-20**
  - `computeRecommendedTier()` in three-verb-utils.cjs/common.cjs, `parseSizingFromImpactAnalysis()`, `computeStartPhase()`/`deriveAnalysisStatus()` with light-skip awareness, trivial tier execution path in isdlc.md, `-light` flag support, sizing_decision records in meta.json.

- **Feature B: Build Consumption** (#60 + #61) [x] ~~Clean build-side consumption of pre-analyzed items~~ -> [requirements](docs/requirements/gh-60-61-build-consumption-init-split-smart-staleness/) **Completed: 2026-02-20** (REQ-0031, merge 5480c98)
  - **#60**: Split build init from phase execution — `MODE: init-only` implemented, `MODE: init-and-phase-01` deprecated
  - **#61**: Smart staleness check — blast-radius-aware git diff intersection, 3-tier response (silent/info/warning)

### Code Quality Gaps

- #52 [ ] Coverage threshold discrepancy — Constitution mandates 95% unit coverage but Phase 16 only enforces 80%
  - **Problem**: Article II of the constitution requires ≥95% unit test coverage and ≥85% integration test coverage, with 100% for critical paths. But `iteration-requirements.json` for Phase 16 sets `min_coverage_percent: 80`. The constitutional requirement is aspirational — nothing enforces it. This means code can pass all gates while violating the constitution.
  - **Options**:
    - (A) **Raise the Phase 16 threshold to 95%** to match the constitution — risks blocking workflows on legacy codebases or projects where 95% is impractical
    - (B) **Lower the constitutional requirement to 80%** — honest about what's enforced, but weakens the quality bar
    - (C) **Tiered enforcement by intensity** — light: 60%, standard: 80%, epic: 95%. Constitution states the aspirational target, iteration-requirements enforces the practical one per intensity
    - **Recommendation**: Option C — matches the existing intensity system. Constitution remains the north star, enforcement is pragmatic.
  - **Files to change**: `iteration-requirements.json` (per-intensity thresholds), possibly `constitution.md` (add note about intensity-based enforcement)
  - **Complexity**: Low

- #53 [ ] No automated complexity measurement — IC-04 relies on agent judgment, not tooling
  - **Problem**: The Implementation Reviewer's IC-04 check says "cyclomatic complexity >10 = BLOCKING" but this is pure agent judgment. No eslint-plugin-complexity, radon (Python), gocyclo (Go), or similar tool actually measures complexity. The agent estimates by reading the code — it can miss deeply nested logic or undercount decision points.
  - **Design**: Integrate automated complexity measurement into the quality pipeline:
    1. **Phase 16 Track B**: Add complexity analysis as a new check (QL-012). Detect available tool by project type:
       - JavaScript/TypeScript: `eslint-plugin-complexity` or `escomplex`
       - Python: `radon cc` or `flake8 --max-complexity`
       - Go: `gocyclo`
       - Java: PMD or Checkstyle complexity rules
    2. **Feed results into IC-04**: If automated metrics are available, the Implementation Reviewer uses them instead of estimating. If not available, falls back to agent judgment (current behavior).
    3. **Threshold**: Configurable per project in `state.json → project.quality_thresholds.max_cyclomatic_complexity` (default: 10)
  - **Same pattern as existing tool detection**: Phase 16 already detects eslint, tsc, jest, etc. This adds complexity tools to that detection.
  - **Complexity**: Low-medium — new QL skill, tool detection patterns, optional IC-04 data source

- #54 [ ] Agent-judgment quality checks lack automated backing — IC-01 through IC-07 have no tooling validation
  - **Problem**: All per-file checks in the Implementation Reviewer are agent judgment. The agent decides if there's a security issue (IC-03), a DRY violation (IC-04), or a missing error handler (IC-02). This is valuable but inconsistent — different agent runs may catch different issues. There's no automated baseline to validate against.
  - **Design**: Where automated tools exist, run them as a validation layer alongside agent judgment:
    | IC Check | Automated Tool Candidate |
    |----------|------------------------|
    | IC-01 (Logic) | No good automation — keep agent-only |
    | IC-02 (Error handling) | eslint no-empty-catch, no-unhandled-rejection rules |
    | IC-03 (Security) | semgrep, eslint-plugin-security, bandit (Python) |
    | IC-04 (Quality) | eslint-plugin-complexity, sonarqube (#42) |
    | IC-05 (Tests) | No good automation — keep agent-only |
    | IC-06 (Tech-stack) | Package.json/tsconfig validation — partially automatable |
    | IC-07 (Constitution) | No automation — constitutional compliance is semantic |
  - **Approach**: Don't replace agent judgment — augment it. If an automated tool finds an issue the agent missed, flag it. If the agent finds something the tool missed, that's the value of agent judgment. The combination catches more than either alone.
  - **Prerequisite**: #42 (SonarQube integration) would cover IC-02, IC-03, IC-04 in one tool. If SonarQube lands first, this item shrinks significantly.
  - **Complexity**: Medium — tool integration, result merging, fallback-to-agent-only when tools unavailable

### Investigation

- #55 [X] Phase handshake audit — investigate whether the handshake between phases is working correctly (state transitions, artifact passing, gate validation, pre-delegation state writes, post-phase updates). Verify no data loss or stale state between phase boundaries. (REQ-0020, b9c5cb2)

### Agent Compliance

- #64 [x] ~~Agents ignore injected gate requirements — wasted iterations on hook-blocked actions~~ -> [requirements](docs/requirements/BUG-0028-agents-ignore-injected-gate-requirements/) **Completed: 2026-02-22**

### Hook Bugs

- #65 [x] ~~gate-blocker blocks `/isdlc analyze` and `/isdlc add` during active workflows~~ — added `analyze` and `add` to gate-blocker Skill exemption check **Completed: 2026-02-22** *(BUG-0031, commit 7f4ad03)*

### Developer Experience

- #62 [x] ~~Stale pending_delegation marker blocks all responses across sessions~~ — delegation-gate.cjs now has `STALENESS_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` expiry check with auto-clearing of stale markers **Completed: 2026-02-20**
- #3 [x] ~~Framework file operations should not require user permission~~ — added `Write(*/.isdlc/*)` and `Edit(*/.isdlc/*)` allow rules to `src/claude/settings.json` **Completed: 2026-02-21** *(trivial, commit 37a1501)*
- #56 [ ] Install script landing page and demo GIF — update the install script landing/README with a polished visual experience including an animated GIF demonstrating the framework in action (invisible framework flow, workflow progression, quality gates)

### Backlog Management UX (from 2026-02-17 gap analysis)

- #7 [x] ~~Phase A cannot pull Jira ticket content — `jira_get_issue` MCP not implemented~~ — added Atlassian MCP getJiraIssue integration to add/analyze/fix handlers in isdlc.md **Completed: 2026-02-23**

- #11 [x] ~~BACKLOG.md completion marking not implemented — items not marked done after finalize~~ — un-nested BACKLOG.md step from Jira sync in orchestrator finalize + added explicit sync section in isdlc.md STEP 4 **Completed: 2026-02-23**

- #12 [ ] Auto-move completed BACKLOG.md headings when all items are done
  - **Problem**: When all items under a `###` heading are `[x]`, the entire heading block should move to `## Completed`. Currently not specified or implemented.
  - **Design**: After marking an item `[x]`, check if all siblings under same heading are also `[x]`. If yes, move entire heading block. Append `— COMPLETED {date}` suffix.
  - **Complexity**: Low-medium — extends the completion marking logic from #11

- #13 [x] ~~Jira `updateStatus` at finalize not implemented — tickets not transitioned to Done~~ **Completed: 2026-02-23**

- #58 [x] ~~GitHub issue label sync — auto-label GitHub-sourced issues as they progress through the pipeline~~ **Completed: 2026-02-19**
  - Added analyze handler step 9 (`gh issue edit N --add-label ready-to-build` on analysis complete) and GitHub sync block in finalize (`gh issue close N` on build complete). Both non-blocking. 2 edits to `isdlc.md`.

### Backlog & Analysis Redesign (from 2026-02-18 brainstorm)

> **Context**: Phase A/B separation is unintuitive. The user experience between managing backlog items, analyzing them, and building them doesn't flow naturally. This redesign unifies the pipeline around three natural verbs (add/analyze/build) with persona-driven interactive analysis and transparent quality enrichment. Inspired by BMAD party mode pattern.
> **Subsumes**: #50, #6, #8, #9, #10, #17

- #20 [x] ~~Roundtable analysis agent with named personas~~ *(GitHub #20)* -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0027-gh-20-roundtable-analysis-agent-with-named-personas/) **Completed: 2026-02-20**

- #21 [x] ~~Elaboration mode — multi-persona roundtable discussions~~ -> [requirements](docs/requirements/gh-21-elaboration-mode-multi-persona-roundtable-discussions/) **Completed: 2026-02-20**
  - Multi-persona roundtable discussions in `roundtable-analyst.md`, elaboration records in meta.json, `elaborations[]` + `elaboration_config` in three-verb-utils.cjs. Built as part of #20 roundtable agent.

- #22 [x] ~~Transparent Critic/Refiner at step boundaries~~ *(GitHub #22)* -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0035-transparent-critic-refiner-at-step-bounds/) **Completed: 2026-02-22**
  - Confirmation sequence state machine in roundtable-analyst.md Section 2.5. Sequential confirm-critic-refiner-accept flow at each analysis step boundary. 45 tests, 100% coverage on new code. Merged d42237e.

- #79 [ ] Introduce Critic/Refiner pass in analyze flow before confirmation summaries -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0036-introduce-critic-refiner-in-analyze-flow/)

- #80 [x] ~~Optimize analyze flow: parallelize and defer to cut first-message latency~~ -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0037-optimize-analyze-flow-parallelize-defer/) **Completed: 2026-02-22**
  - **Problem**: The roundtable analysis flow produces artifacts through conversation, but does not apply the same rigorous quality checks that the build flow's debate loop does. The Critic agents check for mechanical quality issues (e.g., ACs not in Given/When/Then format, orphan requirements, unquantified NFRs, incomplete STRIDE coverage) that the conversational flow naturally skips.
  - **Depends on**: #22 (Transparent Confirmation at Analysis Boundaries)
  - **Complexity**: Medium

- 16.5 [x] ~~Build auto-detection and seamless handoff~~ *(GitHub #23)* -> [requirements](docs/requirements/REQ-0026-build-auto-detection-seamless-handoff/) **Completed: 2026-02-19**
  - **Problem**: `/isdlc start` requires the user to know the command exists, pass the right slug, and understand that Phase A must be complete. If Phase A is partial, the error messages are cryptic.
  - **Design**: When user says "build X" or "let's implement X":
    1. Find matching item in `docs/requirements/` by slug, ID, or title
    2. Read `meta.json` to determine analysis completion level
    3. Auto-detect: fully analyzed (all phases 00-04 done) → start at Phase 05. Partially analyzed (e.g., requirements done but no architecture) → offer to resume analysis or start from current point. Raw item → run full workflow (Phases 00-08).
    4. Staleness check: if codebase changed significantly since analysis, warn and offer refresh
    5. Present clear summary: "This item has requirements and architecture but no design. Want to complete design first, or skip to implementation?"
  - **Files**: `isdlc.md` (build verb implementation), `meta.json` schema extension (per-phase completion tracking)
  - **Depends on**: #19 (three-verb model exists) — DONE
  - **Complexity**: Low-medium

## Completed

### 2026-02-25
- [x] Project skills delivery_type changed from `context` to `instruction` — project skills from `/discover` now injected with "You MUST follow these guidelines" directive instead of passive background context. 1-line change in `discover-orchestrator.md` *(commit d9fb449)*.
- [x] CLAUDE.md consent message fix — replaced formulaic "Looks like you want to..." template with natural conversational guidance. Consent messages no longer parrot back the user's intent or describe internal workflow stages.
- [x] GH-91 scope expanded to "Unified SessionStart cache" — absorbed #84, #86, #89. Verified all acceptance criteria already met. Closed #91, #86, #89 on GitHub.

### 2026-02-24
- [x] REQ-0039 (#90): Replace 24h staleness discovery context injection with project skills — removed legacy state.json fallback from isdlc.md STEP 3d, updated discover-orchestrator.md to mark discovery_context as audit-only metadata, rewrote phase agent PRE-PHASE CHECK sections (01, 02, 03) to use delegation prompt/AVAILABLE SKILLS instead of state.json reading, updated orchestrator discovery context injection to SessionStart cache-only. 3178 tests passing, zero regressions. 7 files changed *(merged d0db4fe)*.
- [x] REQ-0038 (#89): Update external skills manifest schema with source field for unified skill management — added `reconcileSkillsBySource()` to common.cjs for source-aware skill reconciliation during discover workflow.
