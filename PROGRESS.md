# Session Progress

<!--
  This file is the handoff point between sessions.
  Claude writes checkpoints here before stopping, compacting, or at natural breakpoints.
  The /primer command reads this file to restore continuity.

  RULES:
  - Only the LATEST checkpoint matters. Replace previous content, don't append.
  - Keep it concise. This is a roadmap, not a journal.
  - Include enough detail that a fresh session can pick up without asking questions.
