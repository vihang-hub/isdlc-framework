## State File Updates

The following was recorded to `.isdlc/state.json`:

```json
{
  "skill_customization": {
    "last_run": "{{CURRENT_RUN}}",
    "technologies_researched": [{{TECH_LIST}}],
    "skills_updated": [{{SKILLS_LIST}}],
    "tier2_classifications": [{{TIER2_LIST}}],
    "version": "{{VERSION}}"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the updated skills in `.claude/skills/` to verify the recommendations align with your project
2. Manually adjust any recommendations that don't fit your specific use case
3. Run `/sdlc start` to begin the development workflow with customized skills
4. Re-run `/sdlc discover` to refresh recommendations (after 7 days or when adding new technologies)
