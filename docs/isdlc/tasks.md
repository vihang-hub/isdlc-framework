## Assumptions and Inferences

- PID-based health probe (T004) is sufficient for routing; full HTTP check deferred to #244
- Query classifier (T003) heuristic has edge cases; user overrides via tool-routing.json are the escape hatch
- Codex projection update (T015) is a single instruction injection — minimal effort
- Discover-orchestrator.md changes (T014) apply to both providers since discover runs as agent prompt
