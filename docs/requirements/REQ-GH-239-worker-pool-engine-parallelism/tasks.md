## Dependency Graph

```
Phase 05 (test strategy):
T001 ──→ T005 ──→ T006 ──→ T007 ──→ T016
T002 ──→ T004 ──→ T008 ──→ T015
T003 ──→ T009 ──→ T010 ──→ T011
     └──→ T013
     └──→ T014

Independent (tier 0):
T012 (finalize-steps.md metadata change)

Phase 16:
T017, T018 (parallel, both gated on phase 06 completion)

Phase 08:
T019 ──→ T020
```

Critical path length: 4 tasks (T001 → T005 → T006 → T007 → T016 = 5 nodes, 4 edges).

Max parallelism tier: 6 tasks (T001, T002, T003, T012 all start at tier 0; T013 and T014 start after T003 alongside other tier-1 tasks).

## Traceability Matrix

|----------|----------|
| FR-001 Concurrent batch dispatch | T001, T005, T006, T007 |
| FR-002 Unified adapter interface | T001, T006, T007 |
| FR-003 Memory calibration | T002, T004, T008, T015 |
| FR-004 Calibration cache invalidation | T002, T004 |
| FR-005 Throughput + ETA progress | T001, T005, T006, T016 |
| FR-006 Opt-in via config presence | T003, T009, T013 |
| FR-007 Refresh on finalize F0009 | T003, T010, T011, T012 |
| FR-008 First-time bootstrap safety | T003, T010 |
| FR-009 Configurability preserved | T008 |
| FR-010 Install-time opt-in prompt | T003, T013, T014, T020 |
| NFR-001 Memory respect | T008, T018 |
| NFR-002 Throughput 3x baseline | T018 |
| NFR-003 Calibration overhead | T002, T004, T015 |
| NFR-004 F0009 latency | T010, T018 |
| NFR-005 Progress update frequency | T001, T005, T016 |
| NFR-006 Fail-open behavior | T003, T010, T011 |
| NFR-007 Test coverage | T017, T019 |

All 10 FRs and 7 NFRs are covered by at least one task. No orphan tasks.

## Assumptions and Inferences

- A1 Breaking implementation and tests into separate tasks would double the count without changing execution shape, so tests are bundled with their corresponding implementation tasks in phase 06
- A2 Phase 06 has natural parallelism with 3 independent subtrees (engine/pool refactor chain, calibrator chain, F0009 chain) that task-level dispatch can fan out
- A3 T001 T002 T003 T012 are all tier 0 and can start concurrently; starting T004 T005 early unblocks the critical path
- A4 T018 benchmark produces a benchmark-report.md artifact that serves as evidence for NFR-002 and as tuning reference for users
- A5 T020 dual-file check is expected to pass quickly because no files under src/claude are touched
- A6 Installer prompt testing uses stdin mocking for Node tests and bats for the shell path, both standard patterns
- A7 Critical path is 4 edges long at 5 tasks deep, meaning optimal wall-clock with perfect task parallelism is roughly 5 sequential task durations plus quality loop and code review
