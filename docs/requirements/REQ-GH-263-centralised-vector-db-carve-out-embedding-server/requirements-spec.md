# Requirements Specification: Knowledge Management Service (GH-263)

## 1. Business Context

**Problem**: The current embedding pipeline runs locally per-developer — duplicated indexes, no shared search, no documentation sources, OOM on constrained hardware. This doesn't scale to teams or organisations.

**Product**: A standalone knowledge management service — centrally hosted, team-lead administered, developer-queryable via MCP. Ships in its own repo (`isdlc-knowledge-service`) with independent versioning and releases.

**Value**: Developer asks "how does the payment flow work?" and gets correlated results spanning code, Confluence specs, design docs, and iSDLC analysis artifacts — across modules and versions.

**Stakeholders**:
- **Team lead** (admin): Curates knowledge corpus via web UI — creates projects (module + version), adds sources, configures embedding models and Vector DB, pins models, triggers rebuilds, monitors health, views audit logs.
- **Developer** (consumer): Queries knowledge service via MCP through iSDLC. Configures project scope in `.isdlc/config.json`.
- **Standalone user** (admin + consumer): Uses the knowledge service without iSDLC. Manages refresh triggers manually via web UI or CI/CD.

**Success Metric**: Cross-cutting semantic search returns correlated results from code + documentation + analysis artifacts within a version-scoped project.

## 2. Stakeholders and Personas

### Team Lead (Admin)
- **Role**: Infrastructure owner for the knowledge service
- **Goals**: Curate a comprehensive, up-to-date knowledge corpus for the team
- **Pain points**: Currently no shared search — each developer has isolated local embeddings
- **Proficiency**: Technical enough to run install scripts and manage server infrastructure
- **Tasks**: Create projects, add sources, configure models/precision/VectorDB, pin models, trigger rebuilds, monitor staleness, review audit logs

### Developer (Consumer)
- **Role**: Day-to-day user of semantic search via iSDLC
- **Goals**: Find relevant code, docs, and specs quickly across modules and versions
- **Pain points**: Fragmented search — code in one place, Confluence in another, Jira in another
- **Proficiency**: Uses iSDLC daily, configures local settings
- **Tasks**: Configure project scope, run semantic searches, get cross-project results

### Standalone User
- **Role**: Uses the knowledge service without iSDLC
- **Goals**: Same as team lead + developer combined
- **Pain points**: No automatic refresh integration — must wire CI/CD manually
- **Tasks**: All admin tasks + manual refresh trigger setup

## 3. User Journeys

### Team Lead Setup Journey
1. Installs knowledge service: `npm install -g isdlc-knowledge-service`
2. Runs setup wizard: `isdlc-knowledge setup`
3. Selects embedding model source (local ONNX or cloud API) and Vector DB (local or remote)
4. Opens web UI at configured port
5. Creates project (e.g., "Payments 2.7")
6. Adds sources: repo URL + branch, Confluence page links, website URLs
7. Selects per-project model + precision + Vector DB
8. Pins high-traffic models in memory
9. Triggers full embed
10. System crawls sub-pages and linked content, builds relationship-aware index
11. Shares MCP endpoint URL with developers

### Developer Daily Use Journey
1. Adds projects to `.isdlc/config.json` (`["payments-2.7", "inventory-2.7", "order-management-3.0"]`)
2. Works on a feature — iSDLC semantic search automatically scoped to configured projects
3. Gets results tagged by source project ("this came from Payments 2.7")
4. Merges PR — CI/CD step calls refresh endpoint — index stays current

### Automatic Refresh Journey
1. Developer merges PR to repo
2. GitHub Actions / Jenkins post-build step calls `POST /api/refresh` with repo ID and changed paths
3. Knowledge service re-embeds only changed files + their correlated sources
4. Index updated within minutes

### Manual Refresh Journey
1. Team lead adds new Confluence space in web UI
2. Triggers full rebuild for that project
3. System re-crawls all sources, re-generates embeddings
4. Progress visible in web UI

## 4. Technical Context

**Constraints**:
- CON-001: Separate repo — independent versioning, releases, CI/CD. No build-time dependency on iSDLC.
- CON-002: iSDLC integration via MCP protocol only — no shared code, no imports.
- CON-003: Must support both Git and SVN repositories.
- CON-004: Web UI is plain HTML served by the same process — no separate frontend framework.

**Technical Environment**:
- Node.js (ESM) runtime
- ONNX Runtime for local model inference
- Two-process architecture: API process (MCP + web UI) and Worker process (embedding pipeline)
- SQLite-backed job queue for async work coordination
- JSON file config store for project definitions
- Pluggable adapters for both model inference and vector storage

## 5. Quality Attributes and Risks

| Attribute | Priority | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Reliability | Critical | Incremental refresh is idempotent — re-running with same input produces same result |
| Performance | High | Incremental refresh completes within minutes, not hours |
| Isolation | Critical | Project indexes are fully isolated — corrupt index in one project doesn't affect others |
| Memory efficiency | High | Lazy model loading with LRU eviction by default, pinning for high-traffic models |
| Cross-platform | High | Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS without platform-specific scripts |

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Correlation engine accuracy — matching code to wrong docs | Medium | High | Start with filename/path matching heuristics, improve with semantic similarity. Allow manual overrides. |
| Memory pressure from multiple pinned models | Medium | Medium | Web UI shows memory usage. Warn when total pinned model size exceeds 80% available RAM. |
| SVN connector complexity | Medium | Low | Start with `svn` CLI wrapper. Upgrade to library if needed. |
| Vector DB migration when switching backends | Low | Medium | Abstract interface. Migration tool reads from old, writes to new. |
| Web scraper reliability | Medium | Low | Best-effort with depth limits. Log unreachable pages. |

## 6. Functional Requirements

### FR-013: iSDLC Install Integration — Must Have
**Confidence**: High

- AC-013-01: Given iSDLC installation, when the user provides a knowledge service URL, then `.mcp.json` is configured to point at it.
- AC-013-02: Given a knowledge service URL is provided, then iSDLC does not install local embedding pipeline components.
- AC-013-03: Given no knowledge service URL is provided, then iSDLC falls back to local embedding mode (solo dev).

**Confidence**: Medium

- AC-016-01: Given iSDLC connected to a knowledge service, then the status line shows connection status, active project count, and staleness summary.
- AC-016-02: Given the status line, then data is fetched from the `/metrics` endpoint — lightweight, cached, polled periodically.

### FR-017: Source Locator Schema — Must Have
**Confidence**: High

- AC-017-01: Given a search result, then it MUST include a source locator with: project_id, source_type, vcs, commit SHA, path, git_blob_oid, content_sha256, chunk_hash, start_line, end_line, symbol name.
- AC-017-02: Given a code chunk during indexing, then the embedding pipeline generates the source locator from Git metadata (commit, blob OID) and AST analysis (symbol name).
- AC-017-03: Given a Confluence/doc chunk, then the source locator includes: source_type "doc", source_url, page_id, last_modified timestamp, section_heading.
- AC-017-04: Given search results, then every result includes a `relationships[]` array linking to related sources (specified_by, tested_by, test_gap, implements, etc.).
