## Linter Status

**NOT CONFIGURED** -- No ESLint, Prettier, or other linter is installed in this project. `npm run lint` echoes "No linter configured".

## Manual Static Analysis

In lieu of an automated linter, the following manual checks were performed on all new and modified files.

### Files Reviewed

| File | Type | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| `src/claude/hooks/branch-guard.cjs` | Modified | Phase-aware commit blocking logic (~50 lines added) |
| `src/claude/hooks/tests/branch-guard.test.cjs` | Modified | 17 new test cases T15-T31 (~330 lines added) |
| `src/claude/agents/05-software-developer.md` | Modified | No-commit CRITICAL instruction (~6 lines added) |
| `src/claude/agents/16-quality-loop-engineer.md` | Modified | No-commit CRITICAL instruction (~4 lines added) |

### Syntax Validation

| File | Method | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src/claude/hooks/branch-guard.cjs` | `node -e "require(...)"` | PASS |
| `src/claude/hooks/tests/branch-guard.test.cjs` | Test execution (31/31 pass) | PASS |

### Code Style Checks

| Check | Result | Files Affected |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| No stray console.log in business logic | PASS | branch-guard.cjs uses debugLog (stderr) only |
| Consistent indentation (4 spaces) | PASS | All files |
| Consistent semicolons | PASS | All .cjs files use semicolons |
| Proper JSDoc comments | PASS | isGitCommit() and getCurrentBranch() annotated with @param and @returns |
| No unused imports | PASS | All require() calls used |
| No dead code | PASS | No unreachable code paths |
| Module system compliance (CJS) | PASS | All .cjs files use require()/module.exports |
| Error handling patterns | PASS | try/catch at top level with fail-open exit |
| No process.exit(1) | PASS | All exits use process.exit(0) for fail-open compliance |
| No var declarations | PASS | Uses const exclusively |
| String quoting consistency | PASS | Single quotes for strings, template literals for interpolation |

### Findings

**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Info**: 0

## Recommendation

Install ESLint with a standard configuration (e.g., eslint-config-recommended) to automate these checks in future quality loops.
