## Linter Status

**NOT CONFIGURED** -- No ESLint, Prettier, or other linter is installed in this project. `npm run lint` echoes "No linter configured".

## Manual Static Analysis

In lieu of an automated linter, the following manual checks were performed on all new and modified files.

### Files Reviewed

| File | Type | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Markdown | Workflow-First Development section rewritten (~50 lines) |
| `src/claude/CLAUDE.md.template` | Markdown | Template consistency update (~50 lines) |
| `lib/invisible-framework.test.js` | JavaScript | New test file (49 tests, 299 lines) |

### Syntax Validation

| File | Method | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| `lib/invisible-framework.test.js` | Test execution (49/49 pass) | PASS |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Markdown structure verification | PASS |
| `src/claude/CLAUDE.md.template` | Markdown structure verification | PASS |

### Code Style Checks

| Check | Result | Files Affected |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Trailing whitespace | PASS | 0 instances across all 3 files |
| TODO/FIXME/HACK markers | PASS | 0 instances across all 3 files |
| Console output in tests | PASS | No console.log/warn/error in test file |
| Consistent indentation (2 spaces) | PASS | Test file follows ESM convention |
| Import ordering | PASS | node:test, node:assert, node:fs, node:path in logical order |
| Module system compliance (ESM) | PASS | Test file uses import syntax |
| String quoting consistency | PASS | Single quotes throughout test file |
| No var declarations | PASS | Uses const exclusively |

### Long Line Analysis

| File | Lines > 200 chars | Verdict |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| CLAUDE.md | 7 lines | Acceptable (prose documentation) |
| CLAUDE.md.template | 7 lines | Acceptable (prose documentation) |
| invisible-framework.test.js | 0 lines | Clean |

Long lines in markdown files contain prose instructions for Claude Code's intent detection and consent protocol. Breaking these lines would reduce readability.

### Findings

**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 14 (all long lines in markdown, non-blocking)
**Info**: 0

## Recommendation

Install ESLint with a standard configuration (e.g., eslint-config-recommended) to automate these checks in future quality loops.
