## Manual Security Review (QL-008)

All new and modified files were reviewed for security concerns.

### Files Reviewed

1. `src/claude/CLAUDE.md.template` (MODIFIED - Backlog Management section, ~75 lines)
2. `src/claude/agents/00-sdlc-orchestrator.md` (MODIFIED - Backlog picker + Jira integration, ~60 lines)
3. `src/claude/agents/01-requirements-analyst.md` (MODIFIED - Confluence Context, ~45 lines)
4. `src/claude/commands/isdlc.md` (MODIFIED - BACKLOG.md references, ~15 lines)

### Security Checks

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| No hardcoded passwords | PASS | No password patterns in any file |
| No hardcoded API keys | PASS | No API key patterns in any file |
| No hardcoded secrets/tokens | PASS | TC-M1-16 explicitly verifies this |
| No eval/Function constructor | PASS | No dynamic code execution |
| No child_process usage | PASS | No new process spawning (prompt-only changes) |
| No credential storage | PASS | MCP manages all authentication per ADR-0003 |
| No path traversal risks | PASS | No file system operations added |
| No unsafe deserialization | PASS | No new JSON parsing in production code |
| No .env file references | PASS | No environment file handling |

### Credential Surface Analysis (REQ-0008 Specific)

This feature integrates with Jira and Confluence via Atlassian MCP. A key security concern is credential handling.

| Concern | Mitigation | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Jira credentials stored in codebase | MCP manages all auth -- framework stores zero credentials (ADR-0003) | PASS |
| Confluence page content in state.json | Content is ephemeral (used during requirements phase only, not persisted) | PASS |
| Jira ticket IDs in state.json | Ticket IDs are not sensitive (public identifiers) | PASS |
| MCP server URL in CLAUDE.md template | URL is public Atlassian endpoint, not a secret | PASS |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Attack surface change | **NONE** -- No runtime code modified, no new endpoints, no new file I/O |
| Credential exposure risk | **NONE** -- MCP-managed auth, zero credential storage in framework |
| Prompt injection risk | **LOW** -- CLAUDE.md instructs Claude, does not process untrusted input |
| Data exposure risk | **NONE** -- No secrets, credentials, or PII in any file |
| Dependency risk | **NONE** -- No new dependencies added; 0 known vulnerabilities |

### Findings

**Critical**: 0
**High**: 0
**Medium**: 0
**Low**: 0
**Informational**: 0

## Summary

No security vulnerabilities were identified in the REQ-0008 changes. This feature modifies only markdown/prompt files and delegates all authentication to the Atlassian MCP server (ADR-0003: MCP-Managed Authentication). No runtime JavaScript/CJS code was changed, no new dependencies were introduced, no credentials are stored in the codebase, and no new attack surfaces were created. The dependency audit is clean with 0 known vulnerabilities.
