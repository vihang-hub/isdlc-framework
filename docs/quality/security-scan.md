## SAST Scanner Status

**NOT CONFIGURED** -- No dedicated SAST scanner (Semgrep, CodeQL, Snyk Code) is installed.

## Dependency Audit

```
$ npm audit
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 0 |
| Moderate | 0 |
| Low | 0 |
| **Total** | **0** |

## Manual Security Review (QL-008)

All new and modified files were reviewed for security concerns using automated pattern matching.

### Files Reviewed

1. `CLAUDE.md` (MODIFIED - Workflow-First Development section rewritten, ~50 lines)
2. `src/claude/CLAUDE.md.template` (MODIFIED - Template consistency update, ~50 lines)
3. `lib/invisible-framework.test.js` (NEW - 49 test cases, 299 lines)

### Security Checks

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| No hardcoded passwords | PASS | No password patterns in any file |
| No hardcoded API keys | PASS | No API key patterns in any file |
| No hardcoded secrets/tokens | PASS | No sensitive data in any file |
| No eval/Function constructor | PASS | No dynamic code execution |
| No child_process usage | PASS | No process spawning in any new/modified file |
| No innerHTML assignment | PASS | No XSS vectors |
| No .env file references | PASS | No environment file handling |
| No exec() calls | PASS | No shell command execution |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Attack surface change | **NONE** -- No runtime code modified, no new endpoints, no new file I/O |
| Prompt injection risk | **LOW** -- CLAUDE.md contains instructions for Claude, not user-supplied input processing |
| Data exposure risk | **NONE** -- No secrets, credentials, or PII in any file |
| Dependency risk | **NONE** -- No new dependencies added; 0 known vulnerabilities |

### Findings

**Critical**: 0
**High**: 0
**Medium**: 0
**Low**: 0
**Informational**: 0

## Summary

No security vulnerabilities were identified in the REQ-0012 changes. This feature modifies only markdown documentation files (CLAUDE.md and its template) and adds a test file. No runtime JavaScript/CJS code was changed, no new dependencies were introduced, no new shell commands were added, and no new attack surfaces were created. The dependency audit is clean with 0 known vulnerabilities across all packages.
