# Data Flow Design

## Purpose
Design how data flows through the application, including state management, caching, and synchronization strategies.

## When to Use
- Application architecture
- State management decisions
- Cache strategy design
- Real-time features

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Data Categories
### Step 2: Choose State Management
### Step 3: Design Cache Strategy
### Step 4: Plan Data Synchronization
### Step 5: Document Data Flow

## Project-Specific Considerations
- React Query for server state
- Zustand for UI state
- Redis for API caching
- Optimistic updates for forms
