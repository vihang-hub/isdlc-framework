# Vulnerability Scanning

## Purpose
Automatically scan code and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.

## When to Use
- Every build (CI/CD)
- Before releases
- Regular security audits
- After dependency updates

## Process

1. Configure scanning tools
2. Run SAST (static analysis)
3. Run DAST (dynamic analysis)
4. Review findings
5. Prioritize and remediate

## Project-Specific Considerations
- npm audit for dependencies
- Snyk for continuous monitoring
- OWASP ZAP for DAST
- Trivy for container scanning

## Examples
```yaml
# CI/CD Security Scan Stage
security-scan:
  script:
    - npm audit --production
    - npx snyk test --severity-threshold=high
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app aquasec/trivy fs /app
```
