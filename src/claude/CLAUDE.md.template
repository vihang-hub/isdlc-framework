# Project Instructions

## Agent Framework Context

Shared protocols referenced by all iSDLC agents. Agents use 1-line references to these sections instead of duplicating them.

### SKILL OBSERVABILITY Protocol

All skill usage is logged for visibility and audit purposes.

- **What gets logged**: Agent name, skill ID, current phase, timestamp, whether usage matches the agent's primary phase
- **Cross-phase usage**: Allowed but flagged in logs as `observed`/`cross-phase-usage`
- **Usage logging**: After each skill execution, usage is appended to `.isdlc/state.json` → `skill_usage_log`

### SUGGESTED PROMPTS — Phase Agent Protocol

Phase agents emit a SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS block at the end of their phase work (after artifacts are saved and self-validation is complete).

**Resolution Logic:**
1. Read `active_workflow` from `.isdlc/state.json`
2. If `active_workflow` is null or missing → emit fallback prompts (see below)
3. Read `active_workflow.phases[]` and `active_workflow.current_phase_index`
4. Let next_index = current_phase_index + 1
5. If next_index < phases.length → resolve next phase display name (split key on first hyphen, title-case remainder, e.g. `"03-architecture"` → `"Phase 03 - Architecture"`), set primary_prompt = `"Continue to {display_name}"`
6. If next_index >= phases.length → primary_prompt = `"Complete workflow and merge to main"`

**Output Format:**
```
---
SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS:
  [1] {primary_prompt}
  [2] {agent-specific review option}
  [3] Show workflow status
---
```

**Fallback (no active workflow):**
```
---
SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS:
  [1] Show project status
  [2] Start a new workflow
---
```

### CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES Preamble

**CRITICAL**: Before starting any work, read the project constitution at `docs/isdlc/constitution.md`.

Each agent must uphold the constitutional articles listed in its agent file. The applicable articles vary by phase — see the agent's own CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES section for its specific article list.
