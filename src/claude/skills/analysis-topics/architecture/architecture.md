## Analytical Knowledge

### Architecture Options and Tradeoffs

- Identify all possible architecture approaches (minimum 2 for each significant decision)
- For each option document:
  - Summary: how does it work at a high level?
  - Pros: performance, simplicity, extensibility, testability
  - Cons: complexity, coupling, migration cost, learning curve
  - Existing pattern alignment: does this follow or break existing codebase patterns?
  - Verdict: Selected or Eliminated
- Assess risk appetite: conservative (follow existing), moderate (small improvements), aggressive (rearchitect)
- Identify constraints that eliminate options
- Distinguish irreversible decisions from easily changed ones
- Consider phased approaches: start simple, evolve later

### Technology Decisions

- Assess new dependencies: prefer zero new dependencies
- For each new dependency: version compatibility, maintenance status, alternatives considered
- Evaluate against existing technology stack for consistency
- Document rationale for selecting one technology over alternatives

### Integration Design

- Map every integration point in a table: Source, Target, Interface Type, Data Format, Error Handling
- Define the data flow: Input -> Processing -> Output for the full system
- Document synchronization model and concurrency considerations
- Identify potential race conditions or shared-state conflicts
- Define error handling at each integration boundary

### Architecture Review

- Verify architecture is consistent with requirements
- Check that all quality attributes from requirements are addressed
- Validate that risk mitigations from impact analysis are architecturally sound
- Identify any architecture decisions that are inconsistent with each other
- Document open questions that need resolution during design

## Validation Criteria

- At least 2 architecture options are considered per significant decision
- Each option has documented pros and cons
- A recommended option is selected with clear rationale
- All ADRs have Status field (Proposed or Accepted)
- Integration points table is complete
- If only one option is viable, document why alternatives were eliminated
