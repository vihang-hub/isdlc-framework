## Analytical Knowledge

### Keyword Search

- Extract 3-5 key terms from the description (function names, file names, module names, config keys)
- Search codebase using Grep for each keyword
- Report hit counts and file locations
- Identify which hits are in production code, tests, or configuration
- Map module distribution of hits
- If zero hits: confirm this is truly new functionality

### File Count Estimation

- Classify each affected file: new, modify, test, config, docs, migration
- Map the dependency chain: if file A changes, do files B and C also need updates?
- Identify generated files or build artifacts that change as side effects
- Produce total file count with breakdown
- Assign confidence level: high (well-understood), medium (some unknowns), low (significant uncertainty)
- Classify final scope: small (1-5 files), medium (6-15 files), large (16+ files)

### Blast Radius Assessment

- **Tier 1 (Direct)**: Files that will be directly modified. For each: file path, module, change type (new/modify/delete), requirement traces.
- **Tier 2 (Transitive)**: Files that depend on or import the directly changed files. For each: file path, module, impact description, change type needed.
- **Tier 3 (Side Effects)**: Areas that may behave differently due to the change. For each: area, potential impact, risk level.
- Produce blast radius summary: direct modifications, new files, restructured files, transitive modifications, total affected.

### Entry Points

- Identify recommended starting point for implementation
- Provide rationale for the entry point choice
- Map the implementation order based on dependencies
- Flag parallel opportunities (steps that can be done concurrently with no file overlap)

### Risk Zones

- For each risk: unique ID, description, affected area, likelihood, impact, mitigation strategy
- Identify highest-risk areas and highest-impact risks
- Map test coverage in affected areas: what is covered, what is not
- Produce overall risk assessment: overall risk level, key concerns, go/no-go recommendation

### Impact Summary

- Executive summary of total files affected, risk level, and key decisions
- Decision log: key decisions made during impact analysis with rationale
- Implementation recommendations: ordered steps with risk level and parallel opportunities

## Validation Criteria

- At least one directly modified file is identified
- Transitive dependencies have been traced
- Blast radius is consistent with the quick-scan scope estimate
- At least 2 risk zones identified with mitigations
- Implementation order is dependency-consistent
- File count breakdown has been produced
