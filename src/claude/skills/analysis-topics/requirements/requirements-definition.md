## Analytical Knowledge

### Technical Context

- What are the technical constraints? (Performance, scalability, compatibility)
- What existing conventions and patterns must be followed?
- What are the key integration points with other systems or modules?
- Are there any infrastructure constraints (environments, deployment, CI/CD)?
- What is the existing test coverage in the affected areas?

### Quality Attributes and Risks

- What are the key quality attributes? (Usability, reliability, performance, security, maintainability)
- For each attribute: what priority (critical, high, medium, low) and what threshold defines success?
- What are the risks? For each: likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategy.
- Are there any known risks that could expand the scope?

### Feature Definition

- Define each functional requirement in FR-NNN format
- Each FR must have: title, description, confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Each FR must have acceptance criteria in AC-NNN-NN format
- Acceptance criteria must be testable and observable
- Define boundary conditions: min/max, empty states, error states
- Map dependencies between requirements

### User Stories

- Convert FRs to user stories: "As a {role}, I want {action} so that {benefit}"
- Each story has acceptance criteria (can differ from FR ACs -- user-facing language)
- Priority assigned (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have)
- Traces to FR-NNN references

### Prioritization

- Apply MoSCoW framework to all FRs
- Challenge inflated priorities: "What happens if we ship without this?"
- Identify the minimum viable requirement set
- Document out-of-scope items with rationale and dependencies

## Validation Criteria

- Every FR has at least one testable acceptance criterion
- No vague requirements ("should be fast", "user-friendly")
- All FRs have MoSCoW priority assigned
- Out-of-scope is explicit (documented, not just omitted)
- Dependencies between FRs are mapped
- User stories trace to FRs
