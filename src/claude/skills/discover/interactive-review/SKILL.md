# Interactive Review

## Purpose
Facilitate an interactive, article-by-article review session where the user can approve, modify, or remove each draft constitution article. Ensures the final constitution reflects both discovered best practices and team preferences.

## When to Use
- After draft constitution articles have been generated
- When the user wants to customize the project constitution
- When reviewing constitution changes after a tech stack update

## Prerequisites
- Draft constitution articles have been generated by article-generation
- User is available for interactive review session
- Research context is available to explain article rationale

## Process

### Step 1: Present Article with Context
Display each article one at a time, showing the article text along with the research context that motivated it. Include the source (universal template, domain research, or compliance requirement) and any relevant threshold rationale.

### Step 2: Collect User Decision
For each article, offer four options: Keep (accept as-is), Modify (edit the article text or thresholds), Remove (exclude from constitution), or Add (insert a new custom article before moving on). Wait for user input before proceeding.

### Step 3: Apply Modifications
For Modify decisions, accept the user's revised text or threshold values and update the article in place. For Remove decisions, mark the article as excluded and record the reason. For Add decisions, create a new custom article with user-provided content and insert it into the ordered list.

### Step 4: Finalize and Confirm
After reviewing all articles, present a summary of changes made (kept, modified, removed, added counts). Ask for final confirmation before writing the approved constitution to the project's constitution file.

## Inputs
| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| draft_articles | array | Yes | Ordered list of draft constitution articles |
| article_sources | object | No | Source and rationale for each article |

## Outputs
| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| approved_articles | array | Final set of user-approved constitution articles |
| review_summary | object | Counts of kept, modified, removed, and added articles |
| constitution_file | string | Path to the written constitution file |

## Integration Points
- **article-generation**: Receives draft articles as input for review
- **constitution-generator**: Reports final approved constitution back to orchestrator
- **workflow-coordination**: Signals constitution completion to the discover workflow

## Validation
- Every draft article received a user decision (no articles skipped)
- Modified articles preserve required structural format
- Custom articles follow the same format as generated articles
- Final constitution file is written successfully to docs/isdlc/constitution.md
