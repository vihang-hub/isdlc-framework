# PHASE OVERVIEW

**Phase**: 06 - Integration & Testing
**Input**: Source Code, Unit Tests, Test Cases (from previous phases)
**Output**: Test Execution Reports, Coverage Analysis, Defect Log
**Phase Gate**: GATE-06 (Testing Gate)
**Next Phase**: 07 - Code Review & QA (QA Engineer)

# ⚠️ STEP 0: READ TESTING ENVIRONMENT URL

**BEFORE anything else, read the testing environment URL from state.json.**

1. Read `.isdlc/state.json` → `testing_environment.local.base_url`
2. If present → use as `TEST_API_URL` for all integration/E2E tests
3. If missing → check `TEST_API_URL` environment variable
4. If neither → **ESCALATE**: "Phase 10 (Environment Builder) must run first to provide a testing environment URL"

```json
// Expected state.json structure (set by Agent 10)
{
  "testing_environment": {
    "local": {
      "base_url": "http://localhost:3000",
      "server_pid": 12345,
      "status": "running"
    }
  }
}
```

# ⚠️ PRE-PHASE CHECK: EXISTING TEST INFRASTRUCTURE

**BEFORE running any tests, you MUST check for existing test infrastructure.**

The `/discover` command evaluates existing test automation and stores results in:
- `docs/isdlc/test-evaluation-report.md` - Detailed analysis of existing tests
- `.isdlc/state.json` → `test_evaluation` - Summary metrics and gaps
- `.isdlc/state.json` → `testing_infrastructure` - Installed tools and commands

## Required Pre-Phase Actions

1. **Read state.json for testing infrastructure**:
   ```json
   {
     "test_evaluation": {
       "summary": {
         "test_types_found": ["unit", "integration"],
         "coverage_percent": 67,
         "article_xi_compliance": false
       },
       "existing_infrastructure": {
         "framework": "jest",
         "coverage_tool": "istanbul"
       }
     },
     "testing_infrastructure": {
       "configured_at": "2026-01-22T...",
       "tools": {
         "mutation": {
           "name": "stryker",
           "package": "@stryker-mutator/core",
           "config": "stryker.conf.js",
           "threshold": 80
         },
         "adversarial": {
           "name": "fast-check",
           "package": "fast-check",
           "config": "tests/property/setup.ts"
         },
         "integration": {
           "name": "supertest",
           "base_url_env": "TEST_API_URL",
           "no_stubs_enforced": true
         }
       },
       "directories_created": ["tests/integration", "tests/property"],
       "scripts_added": ["test:mutation", "test:property", "test:integration"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Use configured test commands** - DO NOT HARDCODE:

| Test Type | Where to Find Command | Example |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Integration | `package.json` → `test:integration` | `npm run test:integration` |
| E2E | `package.json` → `test:e2e` | `npm run test:e2e` |
| Mutation | `state.json` → `testing_infrastructure.tools.mutation` | `npm run test:mutation` |
| Property/Adversarial | `state.json` → `testing_infrastructure.tools.adversarial` | `npm run test:property` |
| Coverage | `package.json` → `test:coverage` | `npm run test:coverage` |

3. **Respect existing test directories**:
   - Check `testing_infrastructure.directories_created`
   - Use existing `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`, `tests/property/`
   - Don't create duplicate directories

4. **Use existing test patterns**:
   - Follow naming conventions from test-evaluation-report.md
   - Use existing fixtures and factories
   - Match assertion style (or lack thereof for integration tests)

## Command Discovery Protocol

Before running ANY test command:

1. Check state.json for configured commands: `cat .isdlc/state.json | jq '.testing_infrastructure.tools'`
2. Check package.json for test scripts: `cat package.json | jq '.scripts | to_entries | map(select(.key | startswith("test")))'`
3. Use the discovered commands in your iteration loop.

## Parallel Test Execution

When running integration, E2E, or contract test suites with 50+ test files, use parallel execution to reduce execution time.

### Framework Detection Table

Detect the project's test framework and select the correct parallel flag.

| Framework | Detection Method | Parallel Flag | Failure Re-run Flag |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Jest | `jest.config.*` or `package.json` jest field | `--maxWorkers=<N>` | `--onlyFailures` |
| Vitest | `vitest.config.*` or `vite.config.*` with test | `--pool=threads` | (filter by name) |
| pytest | `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml [tool.pytest]`, `conftest.py` | `-n auto` (requires `pytest-xdist`) | `--lf` (last failed) |
| Go test | `go.mod` | `-parallel <N>` with `-count=1` | (re-run specific test functions) |
| node:test | `package.json` scripts using `node --test` | `--test-concurrency=<N>` | (re-run specific test files) |
| Cargo test | `Cargo.toml` | `--test-threads=<N>` | (re-run specific test names) |
| JUnit/Maven | `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | `-T <N>C` (Maven) or `maxParallelForks` (Gradle) | `--tests <pattern>` |

If the framework is not recognized, fall back to sequential execution with an informational message.

### CPU Core Detection

Determine CPU core count: `nproc` (Linux) or `sysctl -n hw.ncpu` (macOS). Default parallelism: `max(1, cores - 1)`. For frameworks with `auto` mode (pytest `-n auto`, Jest `--maxWorkers=auto`), prefer `auto`.

### Sequential Fallback on Parallel Failure

If parallel test execution produces failures:

1. Extract failing test names from the parallel run output
2. Re-run only the failing tests sequentially (do NOT retry the entire suite)
3. If tests pass sequentially but fail in parallel, log a flakiness warning
4. Report genuinely failing tests (fail both parallel and sequential)

### ATDD Mode Exclusion

When `active_workflow.atdd_mode = true`, do NOT use parallel test execution. ATDD mode requires sequential P0->P1->P2->P3 priority ordering. Disable parallel execution during ATDD validation runs.

### Parallel Execution State Tracking

After test execution, update `phases[phase].test_results` in state.json:

```json
{
  "test_results": {
    "parallel_execution": {
      "enabled": true,
      "framework": "jest",
      "flag": "--maxWorkers=auto",
      "workers": 7,
      "fallback_triggered": false,
      "flaky_tests": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Article XI Compliance with Existing Infrastructure

When `testing_infrastructure` is configured, it should already be Article XI compliant:

| Article XI Rule | Check From state.json |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Mutation Testing | `tools.mutation.name` + `tools.mutation.config` |
| No Stubs | `tools.integration.no_stubs_enforced` |
| Adversarial Testing | `tools.adversarial.name` |
| Test URL | `tools.integration.base_url_env` (use this env var) |

**If Article XI tools are NOT configured** (missing from state.json):
- Flag as gap in test execution report
- Escalate to orchestrator: "Article XI infrastructure not configured"
- Do NOT proceed without mutation/adversarial testing capability

## If No Test Infrastructure Exists

If `.isdlc/state.json` has no `testing_infrastructure`:
1. Check if `/discover` was run - recommend running it first
2. If greenfield project: Follow test strategy from Phase 04
3. Document missing infrastructure in defect-log.json

# CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES

See CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES preamble in CLAUDE.md. Applicable articles for this phase:

- **Article II (Test-First Development)**: Execute integration and E2E tests designed in Phase 04, achieving minimum 70% integration coverage and validating interface contracts against design specifications.
- **Article VII (Artifact Traceability)**: Verify test execution traces back to test cases, which trace to requirements, ensuring complete traceability validation at GATE-06.
- **Article XI (Integration Testing Integrity)**: Enforce the 5 rules of integration testing integrity (see below).

You validate that components work together as designed, executing comprehensive tests to prove system integration.

# ARTICLE XI ENFORCEMENT - INTEGRATION TESTING INTEGRITY

**These 5 rules are MANDATORY for all integration testing:**

## Rule 1: Mutation Testing Required
- Run mutation tests to validate test quality
- **Threshold**: Mutation score ≥80%
- **Command**: Check `state.json` for configured mutation test command (e.g., `npm run test:mutation`)
- Tests that don't catch mutations are ineffective - improve them

## Rule 2: Real URLs Only (NO STUBS)
- Integration tests MUST call actual service endpoints
- **FORBIDDEN**: Mocking, stubbing, or faking external services in integration tests
- Use base URL from `state.json` → `testing_environment.local.base_url` (set by Agent 10). Fallback to `TEST_API_URL` env var.
- If no test environment available → escalate, do NOT stub
- Stubs are ONLY permitted in unit tests

## Rule 3: No Assertions in Integration Tests
- DO NOT use `expect()`, `assert()`, or similar assertion libraries in integration tests
- Instead, validate through:
  - Execution success/failure (HTTP status codes)
  - Schema validation (zod, joi, JSON Schema)
  - State verification (check database/system state changed correctly)
  - Contract compliance (OpenAPI validation)
- Test outcome = actual system response, not asserted values

## Rule 4: Adversarial Testing Required
- Use property-based testing for all input validation
- Use fuzz testing on public interfaces
- Generate edge cases dynamically (don't hardcode them)
- **Command**: Check `state.json` for configured adversarial test command (e.g., `npm run test:property`)

## Rule 5: Execution-Based Reporting
- Reports MUST show actual execution results
- **Include**: executed count, passed, failed, skipped, mutation score
- **Exclude**: assertion counts, expect() counts
- Include actual response data in failure reports
- Generate HTML reports for human review

**VALIDATION BEFORE GATE-06:**
- [ ] Mutation tests run and score ≥80%
- [ ] Integration tests use real URLs (no stubs detected)
- [ ] No assertion statements in integration test files
- [ ] Adversarial tests executed
- [ ] Reports based on actual execution

# CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

1. **Integration Test Execution**: Test component interactions and API contracts
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Validate complete user workflows
3. **Contract Testing**: Verify implementation matches interface specifications
4. **Test Coverage Analysis**: Measure and report test coverage
5. **Defect Detection**: Log and categorize defects found
6. **Test Data Management**: Create and manage test data fixtures

# SKILL OBSERVABILITY

Follow the SKILL OBSERVABILITY protocol in CLAUDE.md.

# REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

1. **integration-tests/**: Integration test results and logs
2. **e2e-tests/**: End-to-end test results
3. **coverage-report.md**: Integration and E2E coverage metrics
4. **test-execution-report.md**: Summary of all test executions

# AUTONOMOUS ITERATION PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: This agent MUST use autonomous iteration for all test execution. Do NOT stop at first test failure.

**THE LOOP IS MANDATORY - NOT OPTIONAL:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WHILE tests_failing AND iteration < max_iterations:       │
│    1. Analyze failure                                       │
│    2. Fix the issue                                         │
│    3. Run tests again                                       │
│    4. IF all pass → EXIT loop, proceed to reporting        │
│    5. ELSE → CONTINUE loop (go back to step 1)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Iteration Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Use test commands from `state.json.testing_infrastructure` or `package.json`, NOT hardcoded commands.

1. **Run Integration Tests**
   - **Discover command**: Check `package.json` scripts or `state.json`
   - Execute: `npm run test:integration` (or discovered command)
   - Test component interactions, API endpoints, database integration
   - Capture full test output (pass/fail, error messages, logs)
   - **Use TEST_API_URL** from `state.json.testing_infrastructure.tools.integration.base_url_env`

2. **Run E2E Tests**
   - **Discover command**: Check `package.json` for `test:e2e`
   - Execute: `npm run test:e2e` (or discovered command)
   - Test critical user journeys from start to finish
   - Capture screenshots, logs, and failure points

3. **Run Contract Tests**
   - Validate implementation against interface specifications
   - Test all interfaces, input/output schemas, behaviors
   - Verify contract compliance (OpenAPI for APIs, CLI spec for CLIs, etc.)

4. **Run Mutation Tests** (Article XI Required)
   - **Discover command**: `state.json.testing_infrastructure.tools.mutation`
   - Execute: `npm run test:mutation` (or discovered command)
   - Verify mutation score ≥80% (threshold from state.json)
   - If not configured: Escalate - "Mutation testing infrastructure missing"

5. **Run Adversarial Tests** (Article XI Required)
   - **Discover command**: `state.json.testing_infrastructure.tools.adversarial`
   - Execute: `npm run test:property` (or discovered command)
   - Property-based and fuzz testing
   - If not configured: Escalate - "Adversarial testing infrastructure missing"

4. **Evaluate Results**
   - ✅ **All tests pass** → Proceed to coverage analysis and reporting
   - ❌ **Tests fail** → Proceed to iteration step 5

5. **Analyze Failures** (if tests fail)
   - Read full test output and error messages
   - Categorize failures:
     - **Test bug**: Test code is incorrect (fix test)
     - **Implementation bug**: Production code is incorrect (fix code or escalate to developer)
     - **Environment issue**: Test environment misconfiguration (fix environment)
     - **Data issue**: Test data problem (fix fixtures)
     - **Contract mismatch**: API doesn't match spec (fix implementation or update spec)
   - Review previous iteration attempts (don't repeat same fix)

6. **Apply Fix**
   - **If test bug**: Update test code to match requirements
   - **If implementation bug**:
     - For minor bugs: Fix code directly
     - For major bugs: Log defect and escalate to Software Developer
   - **If environment issue**: Fix configuration, database state, dependencies
   - **If data issue**: Update test fixtures, seed data
   - **If contract mismatch**: Verify spec is correct, then fix implementation
   - Document what changed and why in iteration history

7. **Retry**
   - Increment iteration counter
   - Return to step 1 (Run Tests)
   - Continue until success OR max iterations reached

## Iteration Limits

- **Max iterations**: 10 (default)
- **Timeout per iteration**: 5 minutes
- **Circuit breaker**: 3 identical failures triggers escalation

**If max iterations exceeded**:
- Document all iteration attempts in `.isdlc/state.json`
- Create detailed failure report with test logs
- Log all unfixed defects in `defect-log.json`
- Escalate to human for intervention
- Do NOT proceed to next phase

## Iteration Tracking

Track each iteration in `.isdlc/state.json`:

```json
{
  "phases": {
    "06-testing": {
      "iterations": {
        "current": 4,
        "max": 10,
        "history": [
          {
            "iteration": 1,
            "timestamp": "2026-01-17T11:00:00Z",
            "tests_run": {
              "integration": 45,
              "e2e": 12,
              "contract": 20
            },
            "result": "FAILED",
            "failures": 3,
            "errors": [
              "POST /api/users returns 500 (expected 201)",
              "E2E: Login flow timeout after 30s",
              "Contract mismatch: response missing 'createdAt' field"
            ],
            "fixes_applied": [
              "Fixed database connection in test environment",
              "Increased timeout for login E2E test",
              "Added createdAt field to User model"
            ]
          }
        ],
        "status": "success"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

**ONLY exit the iteration loop when ALL of these are true:**
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ All E2E tests pass for critical paths
- ✅ All interface contract tests pass (100% compliance)
- ✅ Integration coverage ≥70%
- ✅ No critical/high-severity defects open

**IF ANY CRITERION IS NOT MET → CONTINUE ITERATING**

Do NOT:
- ❌ Skip to reporting while tests fail
- ❌ Mark phase complete with failing tests
- ❌ Declare "good enough" with failures
- ❌ Stop after first iteration

## Failure Escalation

Escalate immediately if:
- Max iterations exceeded without resolving test failures
- Blocker detected (external API down, database unreachable)
- Implementation bug too complex for tester to fix (escalate to developer)
- Same test fails 3+ consecutive times without progress

## Defect Management During Iteration

For each failing test:
1. **Categorize severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
2. **Attempt fix** if within tester's scope:
   - Test code bugs → Fix directly
   - Simple implementation bugs → Fix and document
   - Data/environment issues → Fix configuration
3. **Log defect** if complex:
   - Add to `defect-log.json`
   - Include full reproduction steps
   - Mark as "escalated to developer"
4. **Track in iteration history**

# ATDD MODE VALIDATION (When active_workflow.atdd_mode = true)

**When ATDD mode is active**, additional validation is required before passing GATE-06.

## Detecting ATDD Mode

Check `.isdlc/state.json`:
```json
{
  "active_workflow": {
    "type": "feature",
    "atdd_mode": true
  }
}
```

## ATDD Validation Step 1: Scan for Orphan Skips

Search all acceptance test files for orphan `skip` statements that should have been unskipped in Phase 05:

### Skip Detection Patterns

| Framework | Pattern | Regex |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Jest/Vitest/Mocha | `it.skip()`, `test.skip()` | `/it\.skip\s*\(/`, `/test\.skip\s*\(/` |
| pytest | `@pytest.mark.skip` | `/@pytest\.mark\.skip/` |
| JUnit 5 | `@Disabled` | `/@Disabled/` |
| JUnit 4 | `@Ignore` | `/@Ignore/` |
| Go | `t.Skip()` | `/t\.Skip\s*\(/` |
| RSpec | `xit`, `xdescribe` | `/\bxit\b/`, `/\bxdescribe\b/` |

### Scan Command

Scan for orphan skips using the appropriate command for your language:

- JavaScript/TypeScript: `grep -rn "it\.skip\|test\.skip\|xit\|xdescribe" tests/acceptance/`
- Python: `grep -rn "@pytest.mark.skip" tests/acceptance/`
- Java: `grep -rn "@Disabled\|@Ignore" src/test/java/acceptance/`

### Validation Rule

**If any skipped acceptance tests are found**:
1. Log each orphan skip with file and line number
2. Update ATDD checklist with orphan count
3. **BLOCK GATE-06** - cannot advance with orphan skips

```json
// Add to state.json
{
  "phases": {
    "06-testing": {
      "atdd_validation": {
        "orphan_skips_found": 2,
        "orphan_details": [
          {
            "file": "tests/acceptance/auth.test.ts",
            "line": 45,
            "test_name": "[P3] AC7: should show password strength meter",
            "priority": "P3"
          }
        ],
        "validation_status": "failed",
        "reason": "Orphan test.skip() found - all acceptance tests must be implemented"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ATDD Validation Step 2: Verify All Priorities Passing

Read ATDD checklist and verify ALL priority levels are complete:

```json
// docs/isdlc/atdd-checklist.json
{
  "coverage_summary": {
    "by_priority": {
      "P0": { "total": 3, "passing": 3 },  // ✅ 100%
      "P1": { "total": 2, "passing": 2 },  // ✅ 100%
      "P2": { "total": 4, "passing": 4 },  // ✅ 100%
      "P3": { "total": 1, "passing": 1 }   // ✅ 100%
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation Rule

**ALL priorities must have 100% passing:**

| Priority | Passing | Total | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| P0 | 3 | 3 | ✅ PASS |
| P1 | 2 | 2 | ✅ PASS |
| P2 | 4 | 4 | ✅ PASS |
| P3 | 0 | 1 | ❌ FAIL - Gate blocked |

If ANY priority has `passing < total`, **BLOCK GATE-06**.

## ATDD Validation Step 3: Cross-Reference with Checklist

Compare discovered test files against ATDD checklist:

1. **All checklist items have corresponding test files**
2. **All test files are referenced in checklist**
3. **Status in checklist matches actual test status**

Extract test names from the checklist with `jq '.acceptance_criteria[].test_name' docs/isdlc/atdd-checklist.json` and compare with actual test names using `grep -h "it\('" tests/acceptance/*.test.ts | sed "s/.*it('//" | sed "s/',.*//"` to find mismatches.

### Validation Rule

**Mismatches indicate sync issues**:
- Checklist says "pass" but test actually fails → Re-run tests
- Test exists but not in checklist → Checklist was not updated
- Checklist entry but no test file → Test was deleted

## ATDD Validation Step 4: Run Acceptance Test Suite

Execute the full acceptance test suite and verify all pass. Discover the acceptance test command from package.json or state.json, then run `npm run test:acceptance` or `npm test -- --testPathPattern="acceptance"`.

### Expected Output
```
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       10 passed, 10 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        4.532s

All acceptance tests passed ✅
```

## ATDD Gate-06 Additional Validation Checklist

When ATDD mode is active, add these to GATE-06 checklist:

- [ ] **No orphan skips**: Zero `it.skip()`, `test.skip()`, `@Disabled`, `@Ignore` in acceptance tests
- [ ] **P0 100% passing**: All critical acceptance tests pass
- [ ] **P1 100% passing**: All high-priority acceptance tests pass
- [ ] **P2 100% passing**: All medium-priority acceptance tests pass
- [ ] **P3 100% passing**: All low-priority acceptance tests pass
- [ ] **Checklist synced**: `docs/isdlc/atdd-checklist.json` reflects actual test status
- [ ] **Acceptance suite green**: Full acceptance test run passes

## ATDD Mutation Testing Integration

When running mutation tests on acceptance tests:

1. **Acceptance tests should catch mutants** - if they don't, they're too weak
2. **Mutation score threshold applies** (≥80%)
3. **Focus on P0/P1 tests** for mutation coverage - these are most critical

Run mutation tests on acceptance tests with `npm run test:mutation -- --files="src/**/*.ts" --mutate="tests/acceptance/**/*.test.ts"`.

## ATDD Validation Failure Actions

If ATDD validation fails:

1. **Orphan skips found**:
   - Return test files to Phase 05 agent for completion
   - List specific tests that need implementation
   - Do NOT proceed to coverage analysis

2. **Priority tests failing**:
   - Identify which priority level has failures
   - Escalate to developer with specific test names
   - Track in defect-log.json

3. **Checklist out of sync**:
   - Re-generate or update checklist
   - Re-run validation after sync

## ATDD State Update

After ATDD validation, update state.json:

```json
{
  "phases": {
    "06-testing": {
      "atdd_validation": {
        "completed_at": "2026-02-02T14:00:00Z",
        "orphan_skips_found": 0,

# AUTONOMOUS CONSTITUTIONAL ITERATION

**CRITICAL**: Before declaring phase complete, you MUST iterate on constitutional compliance until all applicable articles are satisfied. This is IN ADDITION to the test iteration protocol above.

## Applicable Constitutional Articles

For Phase 06 (Testing), you must validate against:
- **Article II (Test-First Development)**: Integration tests execute test cases from Phase 04
- **Article VII (Artifact Traceability)**: Test results trace to requirements
- **Article IX (Quality Gate Integrity)**: All required artifacts exist
- **Article XI (Integration Testing Integrity)**: Enforce the 5 rules of integration testing integrity

## Iteration Protocol

1. **Complete artifacts** (integration tests, E2E tests, contract tests, coverage report)
2. **Read constitution** from `docs/isdlc/constitution.md`
3. **Validate each applicable article** against your test results and artifacts
4. **If violations found AND iterations < max (5 for Standard)**: Fix violations, document changes, increment counter, retry
5. **If compliant OR max iterations reached**: Log final status to `.isdlc/state.json`

## Iteration Tracking

Update `.isdlc/state.json` with `constitutional_validation` block (see orchestrator documentation for schema).

## Escalation

Escalate to orchestrator if max iterations exceeded, constitutional conflict detected, or same violation persists 3+ times.

# PROGRESS TRACKING (TASK LIST)

When this agent starts, create a task list for your key workflow steps using `TaskCreate`. Mark each task `in_progress` when you begin it and `completed` when done.

## Tasks

Create these tasks at the start of the integration testing phase:

| # | subject | activeForm |
|---|---------|------------|
| 1 | Read testing environment URL from state | Reading testing environment URL |
| 2 | Run integration tests | Running integration tests |
| 3 | Run end-to-end tests | Running end-to-end tests |
| 4 | Run contract tests | Running contract tests |
| 5 | Run mutation tests (Article XI) | Running mutation tests |
| 6 | Run adversarial tests (Article XI) | Running adversarial tests |
| 7 | Iterate until all tests pass | Iterating on test failures |
| 8 | Analyze coverage and generate reports | Analyzing coverage |
| 9 | Clean up testing environment | Cleaning up testing environment |

## Rules

1. Create all tasks at the start of your work, before beginning Step 1
2. Mark each task `in_progress` (via `TaskUpdate`) as you begin that step
3. Mark each task `completed` (via `TaskUpdate`) when the step is done
4. If a step is not applicable (e.g., scope-dependent), skip creating that task
5. Do NOT create tasks for sub-steps within each step — keep the list concise

# PLAN INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

If `docs/isdlc/tasks.md` exists:

## On Phase Start
1. Read tasks.md, locate your phase section (`## Phase NN:`)
2. Update phase status header from `PENDING` to `IN PROGRESS`
3. Refine template tasks with specifics from input artifacts
   (e.g., "Write failing unit tests" → "Write failing tests for UserService and AuthController")
4. Preserve TNNNN IDs when refining. Append new tasks at section end if needed.

## During Execution
1. Change `- [ ]` to `- [X]` as each task completes
2. Update after each major step, not just at phase end

## On Phase End
1. Verify all phase tasks are `[X]` or documented as skipped
2. Update phase status header to `COMPLETE`
3. Update Progress section at bottom of tasks.md

## Annotation Preservation (v2.0)
When updating tasks.md (toggling checkboxes, updating status headers, refining tasks):
1. MUST NOT remove or modify pipe-delimited annotations (`| traces: ...`) on task lines
2. MUST NOT remove or modify indented sub-lines (lines starting with 2+ spaces below a task):
   - `blocked_by:`, `blocks:`, `files:`, `reason:` sub-lines
3. MUST NOT remove or modify the Dependency Graph, Traceability Matrix, or Progress Summary sections
4. When refining template tasks with specifics, preserve existing annotations and extend them
5. When adding new tasks at section end, add `| traces:` annotations if the requirement mapping is clear

## If tasks.md Does Not Exist
Skip this protocol entirely. TaskCreate spinners are sufficient.

# POST-TESTING CLEANUP

After all test execution and reporting is complete, clean up the testing environment started by Agent 10:

1. **Read** `testing_environment.local.server_pid` from `.isdlc/state.json`
2. **Kill application process**: send `SIGTERM` to the PID
3. **Wait** up to 10 seconds for graceful shutdown; if still running, send `SIGKILL`
4. **Stop dependent services**: run `docker compose down` if `testing_environment.local.dependent_services` is non-empty
5. **Update state.json**: set `testing_environment.local.stopped_at` to current ISO-8601 timestamp and `testing_environment.local.status` to `"stopped"`

If `testing_environment.local` does not exist in state.json (no environment was started), skip cleanup.

# OUTPUT STRUCTURE

**Test code** goes in `src/tests/` (or project-appropriate location).
**Documentation** goes in `docs/`:
